    "taxonomy_section": "{1}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe are currently working intensively on preparing our reporting for the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which will take effect in the 2024 financial year, and the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). The disclosure obligations stipulated in these frameworks place significant demands on the entire company. We consider this a welcome opportunity to further improve the quality of our nonfinancial reporting.\n\nToday we are setting the course for a future worth living, together with our employees, tenants and business partners. We are convinced that we can make a significant contribution with our measures in terms of sustainability.\n\nBest regards\n\nRadka Doehring Pavel Měchura\n\nPavel Měchura\n\n{2}------------------------------------------------\n\n### General information\n\n#### ESG governance\n\n#### ESG governance structure\n\nThe ESG Committee of IMMOFINANZ is responsible for all sustainability matters, discusses and exchanges information on current projects and conducts regular reviews of progress, relevant opportunities and risks. It also works on continuously embedding sustainability in the Group, as well as on advancing and optimising the sustainability strategy. Within the Group, the Executive Board is responsible for sustainability topics and formally reports to the Supervisory Board at least once a year, while an informal exchange also takes place on a regular basis.\n\nThe ESG staff position has been responsible for the Group-wide coordination and implementation of IMMOFINANZ's sustainability strategy since the beginning of February 2022 and for chairing the cross-functional ESG Committee. This committee is also implementing the development of sustainable supply chain management in the company.\n\nImage /page/2/Figure/6 description: The image shows an organizational chart for an ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) project group. The chart starts with the Supervisory Board at the top, followed by the Executive Board, and then the Head of Group ESG. The Head of Group ESG connects to the Technical Environment and Energy Manager, as well as the ESG Project Manager. The chart also shows the different components of the ESG project group, including Science-Based Targets, Energy & Environment, EU Taxonomy, Smart Metering, Climate Risks & Opportunities, Investor Relations & Reporting, Sustainable Procurement & Power Purchase Agreements, Employee Satisfaction, and Ethics & Compliance.\n\n#### S IMMO\n\nAs IMMOFINANZ acquired a majority investment in S IMMO at the end of December 2022, S IMMO is fully consolidated in the 2023 annual report. The figures included in the non-financial reporting therefore comprise the entire IMMOFINANZ Group. In analogy to financial reporting, S IMMO is presented as a stand-alone segment to allow comparability with the previous year.\n\n#### ESG strategy\n\nIn the first half of 2023, IMMOFINANZ, CPI Property Group (CPIPG) and S IMMO standardised their ESG targets. Creating these synergies has further strengthened the joint position, allowing the companies to continue offering tenants optimal property solutions. The ESG targets are now summarised under the categories environmental, social and governance. The reported key indicators and calculation methods were standardised, thus increasing the transparency and soundness of reporting. Where possible, the requirements of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) were already taken into account. A new materiality analysis is scheduled for the 2024 financial year, during which the ESG targets will be challenged and, if necessary, adapted to the results of the analysis and the ESRS requirements.\n\n{3}------------------------------------------------\n\nAccording to the portfolio report, the property portfolio of IMMOFINANZ Group (IMMOFINANZ including S IMMO) comprised 518 properties as of 31 December 2023 with a combined value of EUR 8.2 billion, including 432 standing investments, 15 development projects and 71 pipeline projects including real estate inventories. As in the previous year, properties that are held for sale and fall under IFRS 5 are included in this nonfinancial statement (31 December 2023: EUR 258.6 million; see section 4.10 of the consolidated financial statements of the 2023 annual report for details).\n\nThe goal of IMMOFINANZ is the continuous expansion of a high-quality, sustainable property portfolio generating strong returns, while achieving long-term climate neutrality along the entire value chain in accordance with the targets of the Green Deal of the European Union.\n\n#### Materiality\n\nIMMOFINANZ prioritises ESG topics according to their relevance for and impact on its business activities and its stakeholders. IMMOFINANZ's material topics were adopted for the 2023 financial year based on the materiality analysis of 2020 including the revisions made in 2022. As a result, the following material topics continue to be applicable:\n\n| Key areas                                               | Material topics

Ongoing communication and the acceptance of the business by our various stakeholders are very important to the economic success of our business model. We actively include their views and concerns into the orientation of our business and the further development of our product offering.\n\nIMMOFINANZ views itself as a partner to its stakeholders and is above all committed to its tenants, their customers and employees with the promise of quality and safety. Sustainability aspects are integrated in the planning, construction and operation of our properties in order to meet the needs of our stakeholders.\n\n#### Investors\n\nIn our reporting we want to further increase transparency towards our investors and other stakeholders, who are increasingly interested in climate-related topics. To this end, IMMOFINANZ participated in multiple ESG ratings and rankings in 2023. The company's environmental data was again fully and formally disclosed to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) as part of the consolidated reporting of CPIPG in 2023 and received a \"B\" rating (2022 IMMOFINANZ: D). Moreover, the result of the Sustainalytics rating also improved again compared to the previous year. With a rating of 12.5, the ESG risk was considered to be low, compared with 13.1 and 15.6 in the preceding years (on a scale from 0 to 100).\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Tenants\n\nA special focus in the previous year was on the inclusion of our tenants in the value chain. Regular meetings with our tenants took place throughout the year, during which we presented our ESG strategy and looked for ways of working together. We want to be a reliable partner for our tenants in this context, maintain regular contact in order to learn from each other and thus mutually support each other in decarbonisation.\n\n#### Employees\n\nThe engagement with our employees takes place in both physical and virtual meetings. The myNet intranet is available for internal communication. New policies are communicated to our employees on a regular basis. The year 2023 was characterised by strong change, which was on the one hand due to the challenging economic environment, and on the other hand due to the integration of IMMOFINANZ into the corporate structure of CPIPG.\n\n#### Suppliers\n\nIMMOFINANZ continued to work on improving sustainability along the value chain in 2023. A standardised Supplier Code of Conduct for the entire Group was established, which suppliers are required to sign whenever a contract is concluded or extended.\n\n#### Communities\n\nAlthough the operations of IMMOFINANZ are decentralised, the engagement with the communities takes place at both the local and Group levels. The focus is on a variety of topics and current events. In this context, our local teams worked closely with NGOs and local authorities to provide assistance as fast as possible.\n\n#### Cooperation and initiatives\n\nIMMOFINANZ is a member of numerous associations and institutions such as IG Lebenszyklus or Austrian Council of Shopping Places and thus regularly engages with other companies and organisations.\n\n#### Reporting – international standards and frameworks\n\nIMMOFINANZ adheres to leading international standards in its sustainability reporting. For example, the nonfinancial statement is published in accordance with the standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Universal Standards, see GRI index, page 144). The key indicators reported are also based on the Sustainability Best Practices Recommendations Guidelines (2017) of the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA, see EPRA index, page 143). IMMOFINANZ was awarded as \"Rising Star of the Year\" at the Austrian Financial Communications Awards (AFCA), which places the company in the top 10 of the industry. In addition, several ESRS requirements have already been considered in the key indicators. IMMOFINANZ also meets the legal requirements resulting from the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive.\n\n{6}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### IMMOFINANZ follows leading standards and frameworks\n\n| Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)                | Full annual climate submission to CDP as part of the consoli- dated reporting of CPI Property Group |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)              | Non-financial reporting in compliance with GRI Universal Stand- ards                                |\n| UN Global Compact                              | Participant in the UN Global Compact committed to the UN SDGs                                       |\n| EU Taxonomy                                    | Reporting meets the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive                                            |\n| Sustainalytics                                 | Further improvement in ESG rating: low risk with an ESG risk rating of 12.5 (scale from 0 to 100)   |\n| European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA) | EPRA Sustainability Best Practices Recommendations GOLD                                             |\n\nImage /page/6/Picture/3 description: The image contains four logos. The first logo is a blue circle with the letters GRI in white. The second logo is for EU Taxonomy and features a blue background with stars. The third logo is for Sustainalytics and has the word \"RATED\" in gray. The fourth logo is a gold seal for sBPR.\n\nIMMOFINANZ's sustainability management is aligned with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations and continuously advances the SDGs falling under its core business. Since 2022, IMMOFINANZ has been committed to the UN Global Compact corporate responsibility initiative and its principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. By signing the UN Global Compact, IMMOFINANZ supports the world's largest sustainability initiative for businesses, thus confirming its social responsibility.\n\nImage /page/6/Picture/5 description: The image is a logo for the UN Global Compact. The logo features a globe in the center, surrounded by the text \"UN GLOBAL COMPACT\" in a circular arrangement. Below the globe, there are two laurel branches. Above the logo, the text \"WE SUPPORT\" is displayed.\n\n#### EU Taxonomy\n\nAs part of the voluntary disclosure of the non-financial statement, IMMOFINANZ Group also reports information in accordance with the EU Taxonomy (see section \"EU Taxonomy\", page 153ff).\n\n#### Local authorities\n\nPolicymakers, especially at the local level, are important partners in the implementation of construction-related measures and development projects. In this area IMMOFINANZ maintains professional contact with all parties involved and aims to take the concerns of the population as well as the respective overall urban development into account.\n\n### Governance\n\n#### Introduction\n\nThe business model of IMMOFINANZ Group is oriented towards long-term, sustainable value creation that is aligned with environmental, economic and social considerations. For further information on this topic, please see the income statement, FFO, personnel expenses and the indicators for employees, economy and society.\n\n{7}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe acceptance of gifts, corruption, bribery, discrimination, and conflicts of interest constitute a reputational risk and a risk of financial damage for IMMOFINANZ. In line with our zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption, several directives are in place to mitigate these risks. There are currently no indications of systematic corruption risks. We encourage awareness raising among employees via regular courses and anti-corruption training.\n\nWe have made a clear commitment to our social and societal responsibility and to respecting human rights through our membership in the UN Global Compact and recognition of its Ten Principles. Therefore, a due diligence process to identify actual and potential human rights abuses along the value chain will be conducted in the future on a regular basis. We consider there to be a low risk in relation to human rights abuses of employees due to the prevailing legal situation in the countries in which IMMOFINANZ operates. Our newly introduced Supplier Code of Conduct, our internal Group procurement directive, which defines the rules and procedures for procurement for IMMOFINANZ, and careful and responsible selection of suppliers help us to further manage the risk of human rights abuses in the supply chain.\n\n#### Governance and ethics\n\nImage /page/7/Picture/4 description: The image contains two icons representing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The first icon, on the left, is SDG 8, which stands for \"Decent Work and Economic Growth.\" It features the number 8 at the top, followed by the goal's title, and an upward-pointing bar graph. The second icon, on the right, is SDG 17, which stands for \"Partnerships for the Goals.\" It features the number 17 at the top, followed by the goal's title, and a graphic of interconnected circles.\n\n#### Governance body\n\nThe Executive Board is responsible for IMMOFINANZ's strategic direction and company performance in relation to sustainability. The Supervisory Board supports and advises the Executive Board. Further details on the composition and working practices of the Strategy and ESG Committee, which was established by the Supervisory Board, are provided in the corporate governance report of the 2023 annual report beginning on page 34. This corporate governance report also contains further information on governance diversity KPIs (Gov-Board, Gov-Select, Gov-Col).\n\n#### Business compliance and ethics\n\n| Management approach              |                                                                                     |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Impacts, risks and opportunities | Ensuring compliance with legal and voluntary obligations and principles             |\n|                                  | Potential loss of reputation in case of non-compliance                              |\n|                                  | Potential convictions and fines                                                     |\n| Policies and obligations         | Compliance directives                                                               |\n|                                  | Code of Conduct                                                                     |\n|                                  | Policy statement on respecting human rights                                         |\n|                                  | Supplier Code of Conduct                                                            |\n| Objectives and targets           | Acknowledgement of Code of Conduct by all employees                                 |\n|                                  | Annual mandatory employee training on the Code of Conduct<br>and related directives |\n|                                  | Alignment of Executive Board remuneration to ESG criteria                           |\n| Measures taken                   | Compliance training                                                                 |\n|                                  | Anti-corruption training                                                            |\n| Relevant key indicators          | GRI 207-1 Approach to tax                                                           |\n|                                  | GRI 207-2 Tax governance, control and risk management                               |\n|                                  | GRI 207-3 Stakeholder engagement and management of con-<br>cerns related to tax     |\n|                                  | GRI 207-4 Country-by-country reporting                                              |\n\n{8}------------------------------------------------\n\nIMMOFINANZ employees are familiarised with the principles of the Code of Conduct and the compliance guidelines in regularly held training sessions. During the past financial year, an interactive e-learning course on the handling of insider information was held for employees at the headquarters. The members of the IMMOFINANZ Supervisory Board received in-person training. In addition, all employees and the Executive Board were trained on compliance issues, also via an e-learning tool. This also covered how to recognise and act in the event of possible money laundering activity. In 2023, a Group-wide anti-corruption course was also carried out using an e-learning tool. The members of the IMMOFINANZ Supervisory Board received in-person training also on this topic.\n\nThe IMMOFINANZ Code of Conduct forms the basis for the fulfilment of our responsibility and for all business activities and decisions within the company. This code defines the basic principles and values for responsible corporate governance at IMMOFINANZ. It forms the basis for morally, ethically, and legally sound conduct of all employees of the Group. In particular, the Code of Conduct includes guidelines for respecting fundamental rights, integrity and fairness, for relationships with competitors, customers and associations as well as a ban on discrimination. The active consent to the Code of Conduct of all current employees was obtained.\n\nIMMOFINANZ's high standards were also formally established along the value chain in the 2023 financial year by introducing a Group-wide standardised Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\nIn addition, the Code of Conduct, the anti-corruption and anti-bribery strategy and the strategy against moneylaundering and terrorism funding were updated by the IMMOFINANZ Executive Board. These requirements apply to all employees of the company and Group companies and are communicated to them on a regular basis. The employees are regularly trained on these topics. All Group policies are available to all employees on the intranet.\n\nThe IMMOFINANZ compliance directive covers the legal prohibition on the use of insider information for insider trading and the unlawful disclosure of insider information. In addition to regular training sessions, the compliance officer is available to employees at any time to answer questions.\n\nAdvice on the implementation of the organisation's policies and practices for responsible business conduct can be obtained from the persons responsible in the respective departments. The Corporate Legal Affairs and Compliance departments as well as the Legal department are responsible for monitoring new legislation and requirements in the areas of corporate and operative law.\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Anti-bribery and anti-corruption\n\n| Management approach              |                                                                                               |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Impacts, risks and opportunities | Ensuring ethical principles                                                                   |\n|                                  | Avoidance of financial damage                                                                 |\n|                                  | Reputational loss                                                                             |\n| Policies and obligations         | Anti-corruption directive                                                                     |\n|                                  | Management approach to tax compliance                                                         |\n|                                  | Tax risk management process                                                                   |\n|                                  | DAC 6 EU Directive in accordance with the Mandatory Disclo<br>sure Regime (MDR)               |\n| Objectives and targets           | 100% of the Executive Board and employees trained on ethics,<br>compliance and ESG            |\n| Measures taken                   | Anti-corruption training                                                                      |\n| Relevant key indicators          | GRI 205-1 Operations assessed for risks related to corruption                                 |\n|                                  | GRI 205-2 Communication and training about anti-corruption<br>policies and procedures         |\n|                                  | GRI 205-3 Confirmed incidents of corruption and actions taken                                 |\n|                                  | GRI 206-1 Legal actions for anti-competitive behaviour, anti<br>trust, and monopoly practices |\n|                                  | GRI 207-1 Approach to tax                                                                     |\n|                                  | GRI 207-2 Tax governance, control and risk management                                         |\n|                                  | GRI 207-3 Stakeholder engagement and management of con<br>cerns related to tax                |\n|                                  | GRI 207-4 Country-by-country reporting                                                        |\n|                                  | GRI 415-1 Political contributions                                                             |\n\nIn accordance with the UN Convention against Corruption and the tenth principle of the UN Global Compact, IMMOFINANZ summarises all principles of conduct and requirements for dealing with corruption in its anticorruption directive. The goal of this guideline is to ensure that employees, business partners and customers act in accordance with the law, to prevent conflicts of interest from arising and to protect employees from criminal acts as well as to prevent damage to IMMOFINANZ's reputation due to inappropriate donations. The guideline includes regulations on the acceptance and granting of benefits, donations and sponsoring, the use of intermediaries and the prevention of money laundering.\n\nThe Group-wide anti-corruption course held in 2023 aimed to provide training on principles of conduct and ethical requirements using practical examples and to raise employees' awareness of potential conflicts of interest. It was attended by 100% of the employees and the Executive Board. All members of the Supervisory Board received in-person training. The focus was on the definition of corruption, dealing with public officials and persons from the private environment, gifts and benefits as well as consultants and intermediaries. Anti-corruption training is mandatory for all employees and is held on an annual basis. In addition, employees and other stakeholders can report relevant information or suspicions of corruption confidentially and anonymously via the specially established whistleblower system (https://immofinanz.whistleblowernetwork.net/). No confirmed cases of corruption were reported in the 2023 financial year. There were also no legal proceedings pending due to anti-competitive behaviour or the formation of cartels and monopolies.\n\nThe management approach to tax compliance at IMMOFINANZ is based on a commercially-oriented tax strategy with the overriding goal of complying with applicable tax regulations in all of our countries in a transparent manner. This strategy is monitored by the Executive Board, and significant tax-relevant business transactions must be approved by the Executive Board each time.\n\nIn order to achieve this goal, the IMMOFINANZ internal Tax department is integrated into all business-related processes. The Tax department is staffed with experienced tax experts. Reporting is made directly to the Executive Board and the Tax department is involved in the approval process for relevant business decisions in a standardised manner.\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe tax compliance process includes a four-eyes principle. In addition to internal controls, external advisers are also involved in the review process of tax returns.\n\nIn addition, tax risk reporting is collected quarterly throughout the Group and each individual company is critically analysed in terms of its tax risk level including ongoing reporting of all tax audits and litigation. This tax risk management process is also embedded in the Group-wide risk management function. The tax risk management process was audited in the 2022 financial year by a firm of certified public accountants in the form of a maturity analysis based on the legal requirements of the Austrian tax control system. The audit resulted in a very good assessment of the functioning of the tax risk management system.\n\nThe success of this low-risk approach has been evident in tax audits over the last decade, during which no material findings were identified.\n\nAs part of the ongoing assessment of tax returns, there are regular consultations with the relevant tax offices. In addition to regular telephone consultations, supplementary requests and questions are answered in writing via the tax office's online portal. In all communications with the tax authorities, care is taken to ensure that all questions are answered comprehensively, on time and in full. Care is always taken to ensure professional and respectful cooperation, striving for open communication on tax matters. In case of material tax matters, tax rulings are obtained from the tax authorities. No active political influence is exercised on tax matters. We attach great importance to compliance with tax regulations in all relationships with business partners, employees and other stakeholders.\n\nIn the event that errors are identified during the course of internal controls, comprehensive and timely disclosure is made in the form of corrected tax returns or – if legally required – by means of a voluntary disclosure to avoid penalty.\n\nIn addition to local tax requirements, IMMOFINANZ also carefully observes international reporting requirements. For example, a customised reporting process has been implemented to meet the requirements of the DAC 6 EU Directive in accordance with the Mandatory Disclosure Regime (MDR).\n\nUntil now, country-by-country reporting (CbCR) requirements did not apply to IMMOFINANZ, as the relevant revenue threshold of EUR 750 million was not exceeded. This changed in the 2022 financial year insofar as CPI Property Group acquired a majority shareholding in both IMMOFINANZ and S IMMO, and revenue of the entire Group including IMMOFINANZ now exceeds this revenue threshold. As the ultimate parent company, CPIPG is required to submit the country-by-country report annually for the entire Group. This reporting obligation and the relevant deadlines are met by CPIPG. In addition, each individual Group company is required to submit a report on the identity and domicile of the company subject to the reporting obligation to the local tax authorities. This reporting obligation and the relevant deadlines are met.\n\nIn addition, as in the past, comprehensive transfer price documentation is prepared annually in accordance with OECD principles.\n\nStarting in the 2024 financial year, a separate top-up tax equal to the difference between the global minimum tax rate of 15% and the lower effective tax rate will be imposed in order to bring up the effective tax rate of low-taxed corporate entities to a globally standardised minimum taxation level. This minimum taxation system was adopted as an EU Council Directive in December 2022 and had to be implemented into national law by the individual EU member states by 31 December 2023. The minimum taxation system applies to companies and permanent establishments of all groups with combined annual revenue of more than EUR 750 million. Once these regulations enter into force, every single group company or permanent establishment is required to file a top-up tax information return – even if no top-up tax is incurred for the individual companies or the group as a whole. As the revenue threshold of EUR 750 million will be exceeded, all IMMOFINANZ Group companies are subject to the new minimum taxation system. The Group companies will meet the new obligations of the minimum taxation system and the relevant deadlines.\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs shown in the list of Group companies (section 8 of the consolidated financial statements of the 2023 annual report) IMMOFINANZ now has only a very small number of subsidiaries in Cyprus and the Netherlands. These companies were acquired along with the underlying structures during historical portfolio purchases – predominantly before 2008 – and were not for the purpose of tax advantages. Until the point of liquidation, they are being held solely for corporate legal purposes and have no active income (in some cases interest and dividend income). As part of a structural simplification programme that has been underway since 2015, the total number of consolidated companies has already been significantly reduced. The goal is to close all of these holding companies in Cyprus and the Netherlands. All operating income in IMMOFINANZ Group – in particular rental income and capital gains – is generated and taxed exclusively in Austria and in the operating country companies.\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group does not make political donations.\n\n#### Data privacy and data protection\n\n| Management approach              |                                                                                                                    |\n|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Impacts, risks and opportunities | Ensuring that corporate conduct adheres to data protection law                                                     |\n|                                  | Protecting the rights of data subjects                                                                             |\n|                                  | Potential data protection violations and financial penalties                                                       |\n| Policies and obligations         | Data protection directive                                                                                          |\n|                                  | IT directive (data security)                                                                                       |\n|                                  | General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)                                                                          |\n| Objectives and targets           | 100% of employees received training                                                                                |\n| Measures taken                   | Interactive online training on data protection, IT directive and cybersecurity                                     |\n|                                  | Implementation of operational measures for monitoring and reaction to data protection violations and cyber attacks |\n|                                  | Initiative for data classification and risk assessment                                                             |\n| Relevant key indicators          | GRI 418-1 Substantiated complaints concerning breaches of customer privacy and losses of customer data             |\n\nIMMOFINANZ dealt proactively with the increased requirements for the protection of personal data resulting from the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force in May 2018. This regulation not only entails an extensive expansion of the obligations of those responsible and the rights of those affected, but also a very substantial increase in the penalties for data protection violations. Compliance with applicable data protection regulations is therefore essential for IMMOFINANZ and a legal requirement.\n\nThe measures and investments required for compliance with the GDPR were defined and implemented by the Corporate Legal Affairs and Compliance, Legal, and IT departments, together with all business units.\n\nThe data protection directive sets out mandatory requirements for the processing of personal data in accordance with data protection standards and the associated obligations of all IMMOFINANZ employees. Compliance with this guideline is intended to ensure that the company acts in accordance with data protection law, in particular to safeguard data subject rights, define processes for dealing with these data subject rights and avoid financial penalties resulting from data protection violations.\n\nThe IT directive forms the basis for data security as well as responsible and cost-conscious use of the information technology facilities. It also regulates, among other things, access to IT systems, usage of IT resources and smartphones and the procedure for dealing with IT security incidents. The guideline is an integral part of employment contracts.\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\nPart of the organisational measures to protect data and ensure compliance with data privacy law is mandatory training of employees by the data protection coordinator. In the past fiscal year, another interactive online training course was held on the topics of data protection, the IT directive and cybersecurity. In the event of more extensive changes to existing systems or the introduction of new applications, internal and external reviews are also carried out. For the 2023 financial year, IMMOFINANZ is not aware of any substantiated complaints, either from third parties or regulatory authorities, regarding breaches of customer data protection.\n\n#### Risk management\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group has established a Group-wide risk management system. The risk catalogue includes, among others, environmental, social and governance risks. In recent years, IMMOFINANZ Group has placed a special focus on the identification of existing climate risks in the portfolio and their mitigation. These climate risks are identified and analysed by internal and external experts based on annually updated climate models for each location. While the area of natural hazards has already been taken into consideration in the past and IMMOFINANZ Group insures its properties against damage resulting from natural hazards, climate change poses new risks (see climate risk analysis, page 95) that require increased attention for mitigation. The risk position of IMMOFINANZ Group is addressed in detail in the risk report of the 2023 annual report beginning on page 74.\n\n### Climate and environment\n\n#### Introduction\n\nThe acute climate crisis and the associated economic and ecological impacts are the most pressing challenges of our time. As one of the leading commercial property groups in Central and Eastern Europe with a property portfolio totalling EUR 8.2 billion, IMMOFINANZ Group is aware of its responsibility. Our stakeholders also place high priority on environmental issues. Sustainable and energy-efficient properties that meet the criteria of the EU Taxonomy will therefore become an even greater focus for tenants in the future – with potential effects on occupancy, rental income and property valuations.\n\nIn the past year, we focused on improving our CO2 footprint and on further developing renewable energy sources. Reducing our greenhouse gas emissions is a key strategic priority in this respect. In 2023, the calculation method for CO2 emissions was standardised across the Group to allow comparability of the key indicators. All environmental indicators for 2022 were also recalculated using the standardised method and considering adjusted assumptions, and are presented in the adjusted tables. These indicators now also include the figures for S IMMO. We want to continue being a reliable partner for our tenants on their path to decarbonisation and drew up a standardised green lease contract for the entire Group in the past year. Implementing this contract is another key milestone in achieving our ESG goals and in continuously improving data quality.\n\nWe are making an important contribution to the fight against climate change with our standardised sustainability strategy within the Group. The target to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of the property portfolio by 32.4% by 2030, which is contained in the strategy and was validated for CPIPG by the Science Based Target Initiative, is in line with the well below 2°C scenario of the Paris Agreement.\n\n#### Climate risk analysis\n\nThe climate crisis poses numerous risks to the business of IMMOFINANZ Group, at both an operational and strategic level. These climate risks can be roughly divided into physical and transition risks. Physical risks include, for example, droughts, floods or severe storms, but also permanent effects such as the rising sea level or increasingly longer periods of heat. Transition risks are risks arising from economic change. For example, some business models will no longer be successful in the future due to new technologies, rising CO2 prices or changes in consumer behaviour.\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\nBased on the four pillars of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and in accordance with the requirements of the EU Taxonomy, climate risk analyses were carried out for all properties of IMMOFINANZ Group in 2022 and 2023.\n\n#### Green & climate resilient buildings\n\nImage /page/13/Picture/3 description: The image shows three Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) icons.

and sustainability management and the consistent implementation of our ESG strategy. This strategy includes solid and specific targets and milestones. The main goal is to reduce the intensity of climate-damaging greenhouse gas emissions by 32.4% by 2030 compared to 2019. A reduction of almost 50% was already achieved in the 2023 financial year, meaning that the reduction target of 32.4% from the ESG strategy has already been significantly exceeded. Based on the requirements of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards, ambitious goals are expected for the coming financial years.\n\nIn the reporting year, the 2019 baseline was adjusted using the standardised calculation method, taking into account the changes in the portfolio. In addition, we continuously monitor any structural changes and assess whether these require an additional adjustment of the baseline.\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\nBased on a detailed analysis of the landlord and tenant spaces, emissions caused by tenants were allocated to Scope 3, category 13 (Downstream Leased Assets) in the 2022 financial year. In the course of the standardisation of the calculation method within the Group and the full consolidation of S IMMO, these emissions were largely reassigned to Scopes 1 and 2.\n\nThe key levers in reducing IMMOFINANZ's greenhouse gas emissions are the electrification of heating systems and the vehicle fleet, the expansion of photovoltaic systems, and the switch to renewable energy sources, in terms of both the energy purchased by the company and tenants' energy consumption.\n\nThe green lease strategy is one of the measures taken as part of the ESG targets. A green lease is a lease intended to enable both the tenant and the landlord to use or manage a leased property in a way that is as sustainable as possible. The advantages of green leases include cost savings due to lower consumption on the one hand, while contributing to environmental and climate protection through a reduction of emissions and waste on the other; this, in turn, makes the property more attractive for financing or a sale. In the 2023 financial year, the first green lease contracts were already concluded in Austria and other countries.\n\nIn 2023, greenhouse gas emissions are reported for IMMOFINANZ Group for the first time. In 2023 we reduced our greenhouse gas emissions (market-based) by 44.1% in comparison with the 2019 baseline. Due to the full consolidation of S IMMO, the total CO2 equivalent emissions (market-based) of IMMOFINANZ Group amounted to 208,891 tonnes (2022: 242,814 tonnes) in the reporting period, compared to 373,861 tonnes in 2019. IMMOFINANZ Group's greenhouse gas intensity has already been reduced by almost 50% compared to the recalculated 2019 baseline, which means the ESG strategy target has already been significantly exceeded.

The reported CO2 emissions represent gross emissions. The CO2 equivalents for all greenhouse gases from the Kyoto Protocol (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFKW, PFC, SF6 and NF3) were considered in the calculation. Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions include all categories with the exception of 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.12 and 3.14. The areas not included were considered to be immaterial for IMMOFINANZ Group.\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Energy efficiency\n\n| Management approach              |                                                                                                                |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Impacts, risks and opportunities | Creating transparency towards our stakeholders                                                                 |\n|                                  | Lower operating costs due to reduced energy consumption                                                        |\n|                                  | Creating climate-resilient buildings                                                                           |\n|                                  | Higher energy consumption due to extreme weather events, e.g. increased cooling                                |\n| Policies and obligations         | EU Taxonomy                                                                                                    |\n|                                  | Building certifications according to BREEAM, LEED, Access4you, DGNB, EDGE, Green Key, Green Star, HQE and WELL |\n|                                  | Ongoing energy data management                                                                                 |\n|                                  | Local regulations regarding building efficiency                                                                |\n| Objectives and targets           | Reducing energy intensity of the property portfolio by 10% by 2030 compared to the 2019 baseline               |\n|                                  | Digitalisation of consumption data and rollout of smart metering                                               |\n| Measures taken                   | Screening and analysis of energy performance certificates of the entire portfolio                              |\n|                                  | Climate-resilient construction, e.g. architectural features providing shade, green façades                     |\n|                                  | Exchange of cooling systems with heat recovery using refrigerants with limited global warming potential        |\n|                                  | Implementation of structural and technical building optimisations                                              |\n| Relevant key indicators          | GRI 302-1 Energy consumption within the organisation                                                           |\n|                                  | GRI 302-3 Energy intensity                                                                                     |\n|                                  | GRI 302-4 Reduction of energy consumption                                                                      |\n|                                  | CRE 1 Building energy intensity                                                                                |\n|                                  | CRE 8 Sustainability certification                                                                             |\n|                                  | Cert-Tot Type and number of sustainably certified assets                                                       |\n|                                  | EPRA Elec-Abs, Elec-Lfl, DH & C Abs, DH&C Lfl, Fuels-Abs, Fuels-Lfl, Energy-Int                                |\n\nBuildings are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. IMMOFINANZ Group therefore relies on continuous measures to ensure and improve the energy efficiency and to avoid greenhouse gas emissions of its standing investments as much as possible (GHG, see risk report in the 2023 annual report, beginning on page 74). With respect to development projects, we are responding to this challenge by an efficient use of resources, ensuring that operations are carbon-neutral and considering potential climate changes at an early stage through climate risk analysis.\n\nContinuous energy management is carried out in cooperation with the property and facility managers. Energy management essentially comprises the regular services in the day-to-day business (e.g. energy controlling), the development of optimisation measures and their implementation. The goal of IMMOFINANZ Group is to continually reduce the use of resources by means of energy-saving measures and responsible energy utilisation while maintaining or improving the quality of building usage. Potential energy saving measures are regularly evaluated and implemented in the process. Examples include the implementation of combined heat and cooling plants at myhive am Wienerberg |Twin Towers, which led to savings of more than 50% in district heating consumption, or upgrading variable volumetric flow controllers to enable demand-oriented ventilation. In addition, refrigerants with high greenhouse gas potential will be replaced.\n\nIn 2023, a pilot project that allows actively accessing the building management system (BMS) by means of autonomous AI algorithms was launched to increase thermal comfort and air quality while at the same time reducing CO2 emissions and operating costs. To this end, weather forecasts, rate structures of utility companies or occupancy density in different areas are taken into account, and the building zones affected are managed in a targeted, autonomous and energy-efficient manner to meet the building users' highest expectations of comfort.\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\nIMMOFINANZ is currently working on digitally and centrally recording all energy consumption data such as electricity, cooling, heating, water or natural gas. The collected data can then be linked nearly in real time, profound and reliable analyses can be made fully automatically and, if necessary, corrective action can be taken to improve energy efficiency and thus further reduce energy costs in the long run. Moreover, future reporting requirements can be met efficiently in this way. In order to examine the technical feasibility and scalability of this project, two pilot projects with more than 80 digital metering points were successfully implemented in the 2023 financial year. In addition, a comprehensive real-time reporting system including data processing and KPI calculation was developed.\n\nDue to the expansion of energy data management in 2022, the degree of coverage of buildings is 100%.\n\nTotal energy consumption amounts to 714,419 MWh (2022: 742,363 MWh) including S IMMO. Energy consumption thus declined by nearly 4% compared to the previous year. Overall, CO2 emissions (market-based) caused by the operation of our properties were reduced by around 44% compared to the 2019 baseline year.\n\nDetails on energy consumption can also be found in the table on pages 117ff.\n\nDevelopment projects and standing investments in the office and retail segment are to be certified in accordance with environmental standards. For office buildings BREEAM and LEED certifications are used, shopping centers and retail parks should primarily receive a certification according to BREEAM.\n\nAs planned, the proportion of certified space of IMMOFINANZ Group was significantly increased in the past financial year. Additional office buildings in Vienna received BREEAM certifications, version \"In use V6.0\", in the categories \"Good\" to \"Excellent\". With the exception of the Urban Garden building, for which the aim is BREEAM certification of the category \"Outstanding\", all office buildings in Austria have been awarded BREEAM certificates. After the BREEAM certification of another three VIVO! shopping centers and one STOP SHOP in Romania, the entire retail portfolio there has now received green building certificates. In addition, STOP SHOPs in Austria and Croatia were awarded BREEAM certificates for the first time in 2023.\n\nThe certified space of IMMOFINANZ Group at the end of 2023 added up to approximately 1,685,000 sqm or just under 50% of the total lettable area of the standing investment portfolio. The portfolio of IMMOFINANZ accounted for roughly 958,800 sqm (2022: 903,107 sqm) and the portfolio of S IMMO for roughly 726,400 sqm (2022: 496,375 sqm). In relation to the respective total lettable area, 44.7% (IMMOFINANZ 2022: 41.9%) and 51.3% (S IMMO 2022: 34.8%) of the space were certified. The year-on-year increase for IMMOFINANZ amounted to roughly 6.2%.\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Renewable energy\n\n| Management approach              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Impacts, risks and opportunities | Conversion to renewable energies as an important contribution to the ESG strategy<br>Clean and green alternatives to gas are more cost-effective than conventional energy sources in the short and medium term<br>Potential reputational damage due to high CO2 emissions among various stakeholders (banks, tenants, investors, etc.)<br>Potential higher CO2 emissions block transformation |\n| Policies and obligations         | ESG strategy<br>Phase-out of fossil fuels                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Objectives and targets           | 100% of electricity procurement from renewable energy sources by the end of 2024<br>60% STOP SHOP rooftops equipped with photovoltaic systems by 2030                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Measures taken                   | Installation of photovoltaic systems<br>Conversion of electricity supply to renewable energy sources<br>Power purchase agreements concluded                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Relevant key indicators          | GRI 302-1 Energy consumption within the organisation<br>GRI 302-3 Energy intensity<br>GRI 302-4 Reduction of energy consumption<br>CRE 1 Building energy intensity                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n\nIMMOFINANZ is implementing a large-scale programme of measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption in order to meet the targets of its ESG strategy. Therefore, IMMOFINANZ will massively expand its own renewable energy production by installing photovoltaic equipment on the rooftops of its STOP SHOPs and other retail parks. In 2023, our installed photovoltaic systems already produced more than 1,600 MWh of green energy.\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group aims to obtain 100% of the electricity purchased from renewable sources by the end of 2024. This target was already met for Austria in 2023 with the conclusion of a long-term power purchase agreement. IMMOFINANZ is securing the supply of all Austrian standing investments with electricity generated by photovoltaic systems and hydroelectric power from Austria based on an innovative partnership with Stockenboi Energie and ENERGIEALLIANZ Austria. 100% of the electricity comes from renewable energy sources in Austria and ensures predictability over the entire term of the contract for both contractual parties due to the fixed terms and conditions. In addition, a power purchase agreement was concluded for the entire German portfolio of S IMMO.\n\nIn 2023, photovoltaic systems with a capacity of 3.4 MWp were installed in Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Serbia, with the installation of another 9 MWp planned for the current financial year.\n\n{18}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Building circularity and life cycle management\n\n| Management approach              |                                                                                                                                         |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Impacts, risks and opportunities | Use of pollutant-free construction materials to avoid environ-<br>mental damage                                                         |\n|                                  | Responsible use of resources                                                                                                            |\n|                                  | Loss of value due to insufficient information on materials used                                                                         |\n|                                  | Potentially higher consumption of resources leads to pressure<br>on raw materials and biodiversity as well as higher CO2 emis-<br>sions |\n|                                  | Potentially higher waste generation with low circularity                                                                                |\n| Policies and obligations         | Standardised building and equipment specifications                                                                                      |\n|                                  | Compliance with minimum requirements of building certifica-<br>tions for new buildings and renovations                                  |\n| Objectives and targets           | Greatest possible avoidance of landfilling, waste recycling rate of<br>55% by the end of 2025, increase rate to 60% by 2030             |\n|                                  | Reduction of water intensity of the property portfolio by 10% by<br>2030 compared to the 2019 base line                                 |\n| Measures taken                   | Improvement of data quality                                                                                                             |\n|                                  | Use of cradle-to-cradle products such as carpet tiles                                                                                   |\n| Relevant key indicators          | GRI 303-1 Water as a shared resource                                                                                                    |\n|                                  | GRI 303-3 Water withdrawal                                                                                                              |\n|                                  | GRI 306-1 Waste generation and significant waste-related im-<br>pacts                                                                   |\n|                                  | GRI 306-2 Management of significant waste-related impacts                                                                               |\n|                                  | GRI 306-3 Waste generated                                                                                                               |\n|                                  | GRI 306-4 Waste diverted from disposal                                                                                                  |\n|                                  | GRI 306-5 Waste directed to disposal                                                                                                    |\n|                                  | CRE 2 Building water intensity                                                                                                          |\n|                                  | EPRA Water-Abs, Water-Lfl, Water-Int, Waste-Abs, Waste-Lfl                                                                              |\n\nUsage of construction materials containing harmful substances during development projects or refurbishments can have a negative impact on the environment.

In 2023, for example, all newly built mycowork spaces throughout the Group were furnished with cradle-to-cradle carpet tiles. The cradle-to-cradle principle describes a closed cycle of raw materials based on the model of nature, where all raw materials of a product remain in the cycle after the usage period and can be reused. When developing office space, we rely on system partition walls for tenant fit-out which can be moved according to tenants' needs. This way, no waste is created when conventional (e.g. plasterboard) partitioning walls are taken down or reinstalled.\n\nMeasurable targets for waste generation have been defined as a new objective in the standardised ESG strategy of IMMOFINANZ, S IMMO and CPIPG. Avoiding landfilling to the greatest extent possible based on a recycling rate of 55% by the end of 2025, and increasing this rate to 60% by 2030 will make a significant contribution in this context. In 2023, the share of recycled waste in the total portfolio including S IMMO amounted to 37.6% (2022:39.2%). The slight decrease is due to improved data quality. The waste generated in the reporting area of IMMOFINANZ Group primarily consisted of municipal waste and similar commercial waste as well as recyclables (glass, metals, plastics, paper and cardboard).\n\nWe have also set a quantifiable target for water consumption. Although own consumption of water and energy and the environmental impact resulting from the operation of its own office locations constitute only a small proportion of the total portfolio, IMMOFINANZ Group nevertheless aims to further minimise its water consumption. Specifically, the target is to reduce the water intensity of our portfolio by 10% by 2030 compared with the 2019 baseline. Water consumption amounted to 1,995,231 m3 (including S IMMO) in 2023 (2022: 2,019,897 m3). Of this total, 423,640 m3 of water was sourced from areas with water scarcity in Germany, Romania and Serbia. For the definition of areas with water scarcity, the climate risk analyses for the respective locations were used.\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\n76% of the water used comes from municipal sources. The remaining share is attributable to groundwater withdrawal and rainwater harvesting. Here, the largest part is accounted for by the withdrawal of groundwater for cooling purposes at a location in Germany, all of which is returned to groundwater.\n\n#### Green mobility\n\n| Management approach              |                                                                                                                        |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Impacts, risks and opportunities | Enabling the transformation towards green mobility through in-<br>stallation of e-charging stations                    |\n|                                  | Pioneering role regarding the trend towards e-mobility, expan-<br>sion of infrastructure to the extent of future needs |\n|                                  | Lack of attractiveness of locations due to lack of e-mobility of-<br>fers                                              |\n| Policies and obligations         | Car policy with incentive to use e-mobility                                                                            |\n| Objectives and targets           | Creation of relevant infrastructure to enable conversion to envi-<br>ronmentally friendly mobility                     |\n| Measures taken                   | Installation of e-charging stations                                                                                    |\n| Relevant key indicators          | Number of charging stations                                                                                            |\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group supports the transformation towards e-mobility and the use of renewable energies and aims to play a pioneering role in providing the necessary infrastructure for this. The goal is therefore to continuously expand the number of charging stations for electric vehicles, with 729 charging stations already available at the Group's locations at the end of 2023. This way, we want to contribute to CO2 reduction, while ensuring that properties of IMMOFINANZ Group remain preferred places for shopping and working given the increasing trend towards e-mobility.\n\nIn 2023, e-charging stations were commissioned in two parking garages at the myhive am Wienerberg location. A total of 39 new charging points are available exclusively to office tenants and their employees. Thanks to shared use of the infrastructure (without allocation of parking spaces), utilisation is expected to be higher than would be the case for reserved parking spaces. Optimal use of the infrastructure is therefore ensured. As no high one-off costs arise for the users of the e-charging zones, easy access to e-mobility is also facilitated for small and medium-sized companies.\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Biodiversity and responsible land use\n\n| Management approach              |                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Impacts, risks and opportunities | Responsible management of soil sealing due to construction<br>activity                                                                                                      |\n|                                  | Measures to preserve biodiversity                                                                                                                                           |\n|                                  | Minimisation of impact and compensation measures                                                                                                                            |\n|                                  | Recultivation and improvement of biodiversity                                                                                                                               |\n|                                  | Non-compliance leads to vulnerable ecosystems, pressure on bi-<br>odiversity remains high                                                                                   |\n|                                  | Clean environment depends on biodiversity                                                                                                                                   |\n| Policies and obligations         | EU Taxonomy                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Objectives and targets           | Support of local ecosystems by transforming the environment of<br>properties                                                                                                |\n| Measures taken                   | Urban forest project based on the Miyawaki afforestation<br>method                                                                                                          |\n|                                  | Implementation of the myhive Urban Garden office project                                                                                                                    |\n|                                  | Keeping bee colonies                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Relevant key indicators          | GRI 304-1 Operational sites owned, leased, managed in, or adja-<br>cent to, protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value out-<br>side protected areas               |\n|                                  | GRI 304-2 Significant impacts of activities, products, and ser-<br>vices on biodiversity                                                                                    |\n|                                  | GRI 304-3 Habitats protected or restored                                                                                                                                    |\n|                                  | GRI 304-4 IUCN (International Union for Conservation of<br>Nature) Red List species and national conservation list species<br>with habitats in areas affected by operations |\n\nIn its risk report for 2024, the World Economic Forum ranks global risks by their short and long-term severity. According to the report, biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse consequently represent the third largest risk for our planet over a timeframe of ten years. IMMOFINANZ Group contributes to reducing the risk and has already taken first measures.\n\nOne example in this area is the myhive Urban Garden office project in Vienna, which was completed in September 2023. For this project, an existing building with a total area of approximately 17,600 sqm was extensively refurbished. It features several green spaces as well as state-of-the-art and energy-efficient technology. Green façades, roofs and terrace landscapes provide a feel-good atmosphere and an attractive microclimate for tenants. In addition, tenants commit to responsible energy consumption and the greatest possible waste avoidance through green lease contracts. The entire energy demand of the property is covered by 100% green electricity from renewable sources. Facilities also include public e-charging stations and a mobility concept offering the option to use e-scooters and e-bikes. The project is currently undergoing the certification process to obtain a BREEAM certification in the category \"Outstanding\".\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/21/Picture/1 description: The image shows a modern building with a combination of architectural styles. The building has a mix of stone and glass elements, with a section featuring a vertical garden. The building appears to be multi-storied, with a sign that reads \"my hive\" on the side. There are trees and greenery in front of the building.\n\nIn cooperation with local beekeepers, IMMOFINANZ Group has been placing beehives on the rooftops of its properties for several years now to support biodiversity and the enrichment of local ecosystems. The tenants can then enjoy the harvested honey.\n\nAfter the successful test pilot project for an urban forest based on the Miyawaki afforestation method at STOP SHOP Lazarevac in Serbia, another three of these small urban forests were realised at the locations in Sremska Mitrovica, Vršac and Subotica. In this project, the trees are planted closely together so that they only receive sunlight from above and therefore grow upwards more strongly than outwards. In addition to creating small urban forests for the population, the main targets are the preservation of biodiversity as well as the improvement of air quality and the increase of the water holding capacity of the soil.\n\n### Social\n\n### Introduction\n\nOur society is faced with multiple crises, including the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis, climate change, extreme weather events, as well as supply chain disruptions and ongoing inflation. These multiple crises and the complex challenges they present have a strong impact on the economy and require a high level of adaptability. Cost of living crisis and natural disasters and extreme weather events are classified as the highest risks for the next two years in the 2023 risk report of the World Economic Forum.\n\nIn times like this, IMMOFINANZ Group wants to remain a reliable partner and employer and make a sustainable contribution to customer and employee satisfaction. IMMOFINANZ has a number of ways to contribute to a more sustainable world. On the customer side, we achieve this via a high level of customer orientation and the creation of socially sustainable spaces. We offer our employees numerous opportunities for professional and personal development and see benefits such as workplace health promotion or flexible working models as a matter of course. We also play our part in society and work continuously to increase the standards along our value chain in terms of sustainability and transparency.\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 152 IMMOFINANZ GROUP Annual Report 2023\n\n| GRI 2                                                   | GRI standard |

the Taxonomy Regulation of the European Union\n\n#### Reporting practice\n\n#### Taxonomy eligibility of IMMOFINANZ Group\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group thoroughly analysed the criteria of the Commission Delegated Regulations (EU) 2021/2139 and (EU) 2022/1214 in a multi-stage process. In this process, only the economic activity under \"7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings\" was identified as a relevant economic activity for the business model of IMMOFINANZ Group in the past financial year. In June 2023, the Delegated Regulations (EU) 2023/2485 and (EU) 2023/2486 were published by the European Commission.\n\nThe Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486 defines new technical screening criteria for the four non-climate-related environmental objectives of the EU Environmental Taxonomy. The new screening criteria refer to both economic activities already covered by the EU Environmental Taxonomy and those previously not covered. Moreover, the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 on reporting has been amended.\n\nIn the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2485, the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 is amended with respect to the two climate-related environmental objectives of the EU Taxonomy. It contains new technical screening criteria which also refer to both economic activities already covered by the EU Taxonomy and those not yet covered.\n\nIn addition, a \"Commission notice on the interpretation and implementation of certain legal provisions of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and links to the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (2023/C 211/01)\" (FAQ) was published in June 2023.\n\nThe Regulations which entered into force in 2023 and the FAQ were reviewed and analysed in detail. The following changes to taxonomy reporting were identified for IMMOFINANZ Group:\n\nThe revenues from S IMMO's hotel operations are reported under \"Income from owner-operated properties\" in the IMMOFINANZ Group consolidated financial statements. Due to improvements in data collection, data is available for the first time for the activities \"7.3 Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficient equipment\" and \"7.6 Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technology\" so that these categories have also been newly included in reporting.\n\nAs the economic activity \"7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings\" does not constitute an enabling activity pursuant to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, no revenues may be reported as taxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-aligned under the environmental objective \"climate change adaptation\"* . In addition, no adaptation solutions for significant physical climate risks have been implemented so far, which is why no capital expenditures (CapEx) or operating expenditures (OpEx) can currently be reported under the above-mentioned environmental objective. Therefore, the entire taxonomy-aligned revenues, capital expenditures (CapEx) and operating expenditures (OpEx) were reviewed for a significant contribution to the environmental objective \"climate change mitigation\" using the technical screening criteria.\n\nSince the description of economic activity 7.7 and the definition of the technical screening criteria are based on the exercise of ownership of real estate, neither revenues, CapEx nor OpEx in connection with undeveloped land are subsumed under this economic activity. Additions to other intangible assets and other tangible assets are also classified as non-taxonomy-eligible.\n\nWith regard to economic activity 7.3, meeting the criteria of Directive 2010/31/EU and, if applicable, classification in the two best energy efficiency classes according to Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 are intended as substantial contributions. To prevent significant harm, the company plans to conduct a climate risk analysis as applied under 7.7 as well as compliance with the generic criteria for DNSH to pollution prevention regarding\n\n<sup>∗</sup> FAQ 18: Draft commission notice on the interpretation and implementation of certain legal provisions of the Disclosures Delegated Act under Article 8 of EU Taxonomy Regulation on the reporting of taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned economic activities and assets (second Commission Notice)\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\nthe presence of chemicals. We summarise capital expenditures for the installation of energy-efficient cooling systems under this activity.\n\nEconomic activity 7.6 only requires the existence of one of the renewable energy technologies listed for a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation; therefore, heat pumps and photovoltaic systems meet this requirement. A climate risk analysis as applied under 7.7 is planned in order to prevent significant harm. We summarise capital expenditure for the installation of heat pumps and of photovoltaic equipment under this activity.\n\n#### Taxonomy alignment of IMMOFINANZ Group\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group continued to pursue a conservative and strict assessment approach in the 2023 financial year. IMMOFINANZ Group is aware that a less stringent interpretation of the criteria by other market participants may possibly lead to significantly higher shares of taxonomy-aligned activities.\n\n#### Economic Activity \"7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings\"\n\n#### Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation (SC)\n\nWhen reviewing buildings for a substantial contribution to the environmental objective \"climate change mitigation\", a distinction was made, in accordance with the technical screening criteria, as to whether or not the application for a building permit for the respective building was submitted before 31 December 2020.\n\nFor buildings where an application for a building permit was submitted before 31 December 2020, the first step was to examine whether the energy performance certificate (EPC) of the building shows an energy class. To meet the requirements, the energy performance certificate of the building must show at least energy class A. This assessment method was applied to all countries relevant for IMMOFINANZ Group, with the exception of Poland and Germany. As no energy classes exist in these countries, an alternative calculation method was used here. Instead of the energy class, the primary energy demand (PED) of the building is considered, as is done for buildings for which the building permit application was submitted after 31 December 2020. If the nationally defined threshold value for nearly zero-energy buildings is undercut by at least 10%, this part of the criterion is also considered to be met.\n\nAs an alternative to energy efficiency class A, a building can meet the technical screening criteria if it ranks among the top 15% of the national or regional building stock in terms of primary energy demand. For this purpose, a study of CEVRE Consultants s.r.o. commissioned by Česká spořitelna, a.s. was used for buildings in the Czech Republic. This study classifies office buildings of the energy efficiency classes A, B and C (up to primary energy demand of 260 kWh/sqm) as well as retail buildings of the energy classes A, B and C (up to primary energy demand of 545 kWh/sqm) as the top 15% of the national building stock.\n\nOffice buildings, retail parks and shopping centers with more than 5,000 sqm of usable space were examined for the existence of heating systems, systems for combined space heating and ventilation, air-conditioning systems or systems for combined air conditioning and ventilation with more than 290 kW of power. Where this criterion applies, checks were subsequently carried out to determine whether they are efficiently operated and have a continuous monitoring system.\n\nFor buildings for which the building permit application was submitted after 31 December 2020, it must be verified whether the primary energy demand of the respective building is at least 10% below the national threshold for nearly zero-energy buildings. In addition, it must be determined whether the usable space of the building exceeds 5,000 sqm. If this is the case, airtightness of the building envelope and thermal integration upon completion as well the global warming potential (GWP) viewed over the entire life cycle must be demonstrated for each phase of the life cycle in addition to the criterion of efficient operation. Since there are currently no life cycle assessments for these properties, taxonomy alignment cannot yet be shown in this category.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Do no significant harm (DNSH)\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the economic activity \"7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings\", IMMOFINANZ Group conducts a climate risk and vulnerability assessment at the site level in order to prevent significant harm to the environmental objective \"climate change adaptation\". In doing so, a model of a time horizon until 2050 has been used so far assuming the worst-case scenario (RCP 8.5). Appropriate adaptation plans have been drawn up where necessary.\n\nCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 does not provide for DNSH criteria for other environmental objectives for the economic activity 7.7.\n\n#### Economic activities \"7.3 Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficient equipment\" and \"7.6 Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technology\"\n\nDue to improved data collection, taxonomy-aligned capital expenditures can be reported under these economic activities for the first time for the 2023 financial year.\n\n#### Minimum safeguards (MS)\n\nIn its FAQ of June 2023, the European Commission for the first time specified concrete requirements for compliance with the minimum safeguards, which are laid down in Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852. In addition to the previously required compliance with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights including the ILO Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the International Charter of Human Rights, a connection to the DNSH principle was established in accordance with the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). In this context, the topics of human rights (including labour and consumer rights), anti-bribery and anti-corruption, taxation and fair competition were addressed. On the topic of human rights, IMMOFINANZ Group adheres to the six-step due diligence process to prevent significant harm according to the guidelines within the OECD Guidelines.\n\n| Adverse sustainability indicator                                                                                                                                     | Metric                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Status IMMOFINANZ Group                                                                                                                                                                             |  |  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|--|\n| Violations of UN Global Compact (UNGC)<br>principles and Organisation for Economic<br>Cooperation and Development (OECD)<br>Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises | Violations of UNGC principles and OECD<br>Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises                                                                                                                                                                                                   | No violations were reported in the 2023<br>financial year.                                                                                                                                          |  |  |\n| Lack of processes and compliance mecha<br>nisms to monitor compliance with UN<br>Global Compact principles and OECD<br>Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises      | Lack of policies to monitor compliance<br>with UNGC principles and OECD Guide<br>lines for Multinational Enterprises or lack<br>of grievance/complaints handling mecha<br>nisms to address violations of the UNGC<br>principles or OECD Guidelines for Multi<br>national Enterprises | The corresponding due diligence pro<br>cesses are in place at<br>IMMOFINANZ Group.                                                                                                                  |  |  |\n| Unadjusted gender pay gap                                                                                                                                            | Average unadjusted gender pay gap                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Gender pay gap has been reported since<br>2020.

Commission Delegated Regulation 2021/2178 can be found on pages 153ff.\n\n#### Revenues\n\nThe proportion of taxonomy-aligned economic activities in total revenues was calculated as the part of net revenues derived from products and services associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities (numerator), divided by net revenues (denominator), each for the financial year from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023.\n\nIn accordance with the Delegated Act on Art. 8 of the EU Taxonomy, the revenue KPI is based on the consolidated revenues of IMMOFINANZ Group (see the consolidated income statement in the consolidated financial statements of the 2023 annual report) and relates primarily to rental income and operating costs charged to tenants. The numerator of the revenue KPI is based on the taxonomy-aligned proportion of the economic activity \"7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings\" with reference to making a substantial contribution to the environmental objective \"climate change mitigation\" and is broken down into the following items:\n\n| in MEUR                                | 2023  | 2022  |\n|----------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Revenues from contracts with customers | 190.6 | 118.6 |\n| Revenues from leases                   | 533.6 | 300.2 |\n| Other revenues                         | 2.7   | 3.4   |\n| IMMOFINANZ Group                       | 727.0 | 422.2 |\n\nThe increase in total revenues is caused by the first-time consolidation of S IMMO.\n\n#### Capital expenditures (CapEx)\n\nThe key performance indicator capital expenditure (CapEx) is defined as the proportion of taxonomy-aligned capital expenditures (numerator) divided by IMMOFINANZ Group's total capital expenditures (denominator).\n\nThe denominator comprises additions to investment property, property under construction, owner-operated property, other tangible assets and intangible assets for the 2023 financial year before depreciation and amortisation and revaluations. In the 2023 financial year, no additions resulting from business combinations which could have been taken into account for the denominator occurred. Our total capital expenditures essentially correspond to the sum of additions including changes in the scope of consolidation in accordance with the statement of changes in fixed assets (see 4.1 and 4.2 in the consolidated financial statements). Differences result from including additions to owner-operated property, other tangible assets and intangible assets in the denominator of the CapEx KPI which are not presented separately in the notes. The numerator includes capital expenditures related to assets or processes that are associated with taxonomy-aligned proportions of economic activity 7.7. Here, IMMOFINANZ Group considers capital expenditures that are material to maintaining and performing the economic activity. The principle of allocation here is the generation of external revenues through the economic activity \"7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings\". Consequently, all capital expenditures in taxonomy-aligned properties are considered in the numerator of the performance indicator.\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group analysed the requirements for a CapEx plan, and came to the decision not to prepare a CapEx plan in the 2023 financial year. This is because prior to preparing the CapEx plan it must be ensured that any upgrading measures can actually guarantee meeting the criteria to make a substantial contribution to one of the environmental objectives. The aim is therefore to prepare a CapEx plan in the 2024 financial year.\n\nDue to the continuous improvement in data collection, CapEx category C can be shown in 2023 for the first time. In order to avoid double counting of capital expenditures, IMMOFINANZ Group only recognised capital expenditures under category C which are not related to taxonomy-aligned properties. Capital expenditures relating to taxonomy-aligned buildings are recognised under category A.\n\nThe numerator of taxonomy-aligned capital expenditures can be broken down as follows in accordance with Annex 1 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178:\n\n| in MEUR                                                      | 2023  | 2022  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment                         | 8.2   | 0.0   |\n| IAS 40 Investment property                                   | 379.2 | 275.6 |\n| IFRS 16 Leases (>12 months)                                  | 0.0   | 0.0   |\n| IMMOFINANZ Group                                             | 387.4 | 275.6 |\n| thereof resulting from changes in the scope of consolidation | 354.7 | 232.5 |\n\nThe increase in total capital expenditures is caused by the first-time consolidation of S IMMO.\n\n#### Operating expenditure (OpEx)\n\nThe key performance indicator operating expenditure (OpEx) is defined as the proportion of taxonomy-aligned operating expenditures (numerator) divided by total operating expenditures (denominator). The classification of the operating expenditures can be derived analogously from the categories of capital expenditures.\n\nTotal operating expenditures consist of non-capitalised costs that relate to building renovation measures, maintenance and repair as well as any other direct expenditures in connection with the day-to-day servicing of investment property, property under construction and owner-operated property.\n\nThe numerator of taxonomy-aligned operating expenditure can be broken down as follows pursuant to Annex 1 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178:\n\n| in MEUR                                       | 2023 | 2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Costs related to building renovation measures | 0.3  | 0.4  |\n| Maintenance and repair costs                  | 3.0  | 2.7  |\n| S IMMO                                        | 0.8  | 0.0  |\n| IMMOFINANZ Group                              | 4.1  | 3.1  |\n\nThe increase in total operating expenditures is caused by the first-time consolidation of S IMMO.\n\nWe exclude direct training costs from the denominator and the numerator. The reason is that Annex I of the Delegated Act on the disclosure only lists these costs for the numerator, which does not allow for a mathematically meaningful calculation of the OpEx KPI.\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\nTemplate: Proportion of turnover from products or services associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities – disclosure covering year 2023\n\n| 2023                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                  |          |                                   | Substantial contribution criteria  |                                    |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  |  |  |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|--|--|\n| Economic<br>activities                                                                                                                   | Code (a)                                                                                         | Turnover | Proportion<br>of turnover<br>2023 | Climate change<br>mitigation (CCM) | Climate change<br>adaptation (CCA) | Water (WTR)                      | Pollution (PPC)                  | Circular<br>economy (CE)         | Biodiversity (BIO)               |  |  |\n|                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                  | in MEUR  | in %                              | Y; N;<br>N/EL<br>(b) (c)<br>in %   | Y; N;<br>N/EL<br>(b) (c)<br>in %   | Y; N;<br>N/EL<br>(b) (c)<br>in % | Y; N;<br>N/EL<br>(b) (c)<br>in % | Y; N;<br>N/EL<br>(b) (c)<br>in % | Y; N;<br>N/EL<br>(b) (c)<br>in % |  |  |\n|                                                                                                                                          | A.

The Executive Board provided the Supervisory Board with extensive, ongoing and timely information on the development of business, the market and financing environment, the developments on the real estate and capital markets and in IMMOFINANZ's core countries as well as the company's asset, financial and earnings position and, in this way, met its information requirements at all times and in appropriate depth.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year ten Supervisory Board meetings were held, with an attendance rate of 93% of the shareholder representatives. In addition, four committee meetings with a total attendance of 94% took place. A detailed overview of the attendance of the individual members and committees can be found in the corporate governance report.\n\nOutside the framework of these meetings, the Supervisory Board remained in regular contact with the Executive Board and adopted a number of decisions through circular resolutions. The cooperation between the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board was consistently characterised by open discussions and constructive teamwork.\n\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board completed a routine annual self-evaluation of its working efficiency, above all with regard to its organisation and operating procedures.\n\n#### Focal points of our work\n\nIn June 2022, we had adopted a strategy update after becoming part of CPI Property Group and made significant progress in its implementation in 2023. Specifically, we are concentrating more than ever on a flexible and innovative property offering with a strong customer focus. A robust financial policy, which targets sufficient liquidity at all times, a balanced capital structure and maturity profile as well as optimising our financing costs, constitutes another cornerstone of this strategy.\n\nWith regard to its portfolio, IMMOFINANZ aims to achieve further optimisation through targeted acquisitions and, in some cases, through development projects, always with a focus on higher-yielding properties. The refurbishment of standing investments, in which we always give special consideration to aspects of sustainability, represents another central focus of our portfolio strategy. Moreover, strategic property sales also form part of our active portfolio management. Here, we are aiming to streamline our standing investments, thus creating the basis for further successful growth.\n\n#### Changes in the Supervisory Board\n\nIn the past financial year, shareholder representative Gayatri Narayan resigned from the IMMOFINANZ Supervisory Board with effect from 31 December 2023, and employee representative Werner Ertelthalner with effect from 3 May 2023, both at their own request.\n\nThe shareholder representatives are thus Martin Němeček (Vice-Chairman), Martin Matula and I in my role as Chairwoman. The Supervisory Board is completed by Philipp Obermair and Anton Weichselbaum on the employee side, with whom we have very good cooperation.\n\nOn behalf of the entire Supervisory Board, I would like to thank the members who resigned from their functions for their professional work and their support of IMMOFINANZ.\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Changes in the Executive Board\n\nWith effect from 16 June 2023, the Supervisory Board appointed Pavel Měchura as a member of the Executive Board. Pavel Měchura is a top-class manager, who has long-standing and comprehensive expertise in the finance and real estate sector as well as in transformation processes and strategic planning. The Executive Board thus consists of Radka Doehring and Pavel Měchura. Radka Doehring's mandate was extended early on 19 July 2023 for a total period of five years, hence until the end of April 2027.\n\n#### Approval of the 2023 annual financial statements\n\nThe following documents were prepared by the Executive Board and audited by Ernst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H., which was appointed as the auditor by the annual general meeting on 3 May 2023: the annual financial statements of IMMOFINANZ AG as of 31 December 2023 including the management report and the consolidated financial statements together with the group management report. All of these documents were awarded an unqualified opinion (see auditor's report in the consolidated financial statements).\n\nThe annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements as well as the related auditor's reports were made available to all Supervisory Board members immediately after their completion. These documents were discussed by the Audit and Valuation Committee in detail in the presence of the auditor and the Executive Board and reviewed in accordance with § 96 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act. Following this examination and discussion, the members of the Audit and Valuation Committee agreed to recommend the unqualified acceptance of these documents to the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board accepted the annual financial statements as of 31 December 2023, which are considered approved in accordance with § 96 (4) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act. The consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2023 were also accepted by the Supervisory Board. In accordance with L-Rule 60 of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code, the Supervisory Board reviewed and approved the expanded corporate governance report, which now also includes the consolidated corporate governance report and the non-financial statement.\n\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board, I would like to thank the Executive Board and all employees of our company for their outstanding performance during the past financial year. IMMOFINANZ's position as a market leader for retail parks in Europe and its pioneering role in flexible office solutions were further expanded despite the difficult economic environment.\n\nI would also like to thank you, our shareholders, for accompanying us on this journey.\n\nVienna, 27 March 2024\n\nMiroslava Greštiaková Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-5-0\"></span>Corporate Governance Report\n\nexpanded to include the Consolidated Corporate Governance Report\n\n## Commitment to the Austrian Corporate Governance Code\n\nIMMOFINANZ pursues responsible business activities that are designed to create and maintain sustainable, long-term value. In line with this orientation, the company strives to achieve a high degree of transparency for all stakeholders. The Austrian Corporate Governance Code<sup>\\*</sup> provides Austrian stock companies with a framework for corporate management and monitoring. The Executive Board and Supervisory Board of IMMOFINANZ AG are committed to compliance with the code, in the currently applicable version, and to the related transparency and principles of good management. IMMOFINANZ complied with all provisions of the code – with the exception of the following temporary deviation – during the 2023 financial year.\n\n#### Deviation from C-Rule 16\n\nC-Rule 16 requires the Executive Board to have several members and a chairperson. Radka Doehring was the sole member of the Executive Board until 16 June 2023. With effect from 16 June 2023, Pavel Měchura was appointed a member of the Executive Board. Hence, the Executive Board now consists of Radka Doehring and Pavel Měchura. The Supervisory Board did not consider it necessary to appoint a CEO.\n\n## Corporate Bodies\n\n### Dual management structure\n\nThe dual management structure of IMMOFINANZ AG, as a listed stock corporation, consists of an Executive Board and a Supervisory Board. These corporate bodies are strictly separated, in both their composition and functions, and can therefore independently carry out their assigned duties. The Executive Board is responsible for the management of the company, the Supervisory Board for monitoring.\n\n{6}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### The Executive Board\n\nImage /page/6/Picture/2 description: A portrait of a woman with shoulder-length dark brown hair and glasses.

In addition to its primary function as a monitoring and support body, the Supervisory Board constantly strives to further improve the efficiency of its work through self-evaluation. At the beginning of the 2023 financial year, the Supervisory Board had four members who were elected by the annual general meeting (shareholder representatives) and two members delegated by the Works Council. Gayatri Narayan resigned from her function with effect from 31 December 2023. Ten Supervisory Board meetings were held in 2023. These meetings were attended by 93% of the shareholder representatives. Including the four individual committee meetings, total attendance was 93%.\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                             | Attendance      |                      |      |                                     |      |                                  |      |                                             |      |                   |                           |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|------|-------------------------------------|------|----------------------------------|------|---------------------------------------------|------|-------------------|---------------------------|\n| Member                                      | Member<br>since | Meetings<br>(Plenum) | in % | Audit and<br>Valuation<br>Committee | in % | Strategy<br>and ESG<br>Committee | in % | Personnel<br>and<br>Nominating<br>Committee | in % | Total<br>presence | Total<br>presence<br>in % |\n| Meetings/year                               |                 | 10                   |      | 4                                   |      |                                  |      |                                             |      | 14                |                           |\n| Miroslava Greštiaková,<br>Chairwoman        | 2022            | 10/10                | 100  | 4/4                                 | 100  |                                  |      |                                             |      | 14                | 100                       |\n| Martin Němeček,<br>Vice-Chairman            | 2022            | 10/10                | 100  | 4/4                                 | 100  |                                  |      |                                             |      | 14                | 100                       |\n| Martin Matula                               | 2022            | 10/10                | 100  | 4/4                                 | 100  |                                  |      |                                             |      | 14                | 100                       |\n| Gayatri Narayan (up to<br>31 December 2023) | 2021            | 7/10                 | 70   | 3/4                                 | 75   |                                  |      |                                             |      | 10                | 71                        |\n| Average meeting<br>attendance               |                 | 37/40                | 93   | 15/16                               | 94   |                                  |      |                                             |      | 52/56             | 93                        |\n\n#### Audit and Valuation Committee\n\nThe Audit and Valuation Committee is responsible for monitoring accounting processes and supervising the audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements. This committee also monitors the effectiveness of the company's internal control system, risk management and internal audit. In the 2023 financial year, Martin Němeček and Gayatri Narayan served as the Audit and Valuation Committee's financial experts based on their professional experience and knowledge of finance and accounting. The committee members, as a whole, are well informed of the real estate sector. The Audit and Valuation Committee held four meetings in 2023. These meetings were attended by 94% of the shareholder representatives.\n\n#### Strategy and ESG Committee\n\nThe Strategy and ESG Committee is responsible, above all, for the regular evaluation of the company's strategy and orientation, of which environmental, sustainability, social and governance topics (ESG) are an integral part. These responsibilities were fulfilled by the full Supervisory Board in the past financial year.\n\n#### Personnel and Nominating Committee\n\nThe Personnel and Nominating Committee makes recommendations to the Supervisory Board for nominations to the Executive and Supervisory Boards and is responsible for determining the remuneration and preparing the employment contracts for the Executive Board members. In addition, the committee reviews the remuneration policy for the Executive Board at regular intervals. In its capacity as a remuneration committee, the Personnel and Nominating Committee consisted of Gayatri Narayan as Chairwoman and at least one member with knowledge and experience in remuneration policy until 31 December 2023. The responsibilities were exercised by the full Supervisory Board in the past financial year.\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Supervisory Board qualification matrix\n\nAs in the previous years, the Supervisory Board also completed a routine annual self-evaluation of its working efficiency, above all with regard to its organisation and operating procedures. The focal points included, among others, the organisation of the Supervisory Board and the procedures at meetings, the activities of the committees, the provision of information to the Supervisory Board, the self-image of the Supervisory Board members as well as any recommendations for improvement.\n\nImage /page/10/Figure/3 description: This image is a table that shows the sectoral, functional, and governance expertise of four people: Miroslava Greštiaková, Martin Němeček, Martin Matula, and Gayatri Narayan. The table also shows the geographic experience of each person. The sectoral expertise includes real estate, capital markets, insurance, and finance.

These reports (\"Directors' Dealings\") are published on the IMMOFINANZ website. Following is an overview of the direct and indirect shareholdings of these members as reported to the company:\n\n| Member           | Number of IMMOFINANZ<br>shares |\n|------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Philipp Obermair | 300                            |\n\n#### Working Procedures of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board\n\nThe cooperation between the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of IMMOFINANZ is based on open and constructive discussions. The Executive Board provides the Supervisory Board with regular, timely and comprehensive information on the development of business and related issues and also prepares the documentation for the Supervisory Board's meetings and resolutions. The rules of procedure for the Executive Board define the transactions and measures that require Supervisory Board approval. In addition, the Executive Board provides the Supervisory Board with information on issues of major importance outside the framework of scheduled meetings.\n\n#### Independence and avoidance of conflicts of interest\n\nThe members of the Executive Board are required to take their decisions independent of any personal interests and the interests of controlling shareholders. Moreover, these decisions must be based on well-founded knowledge and comply with all relevant legal regulations. Persons serving on the Executive Board must disclose any personal interests in the company's transactions or other conflicts of interest to the Supervisory Board without delay and inform their board colleagues. The Executive Board members may only accept appointments to a supervisory board with the consent of the IMMOFINANZ Supervisory Board. Key company employees must also have the approval of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board before they may accept a position on the corporate body of a non-Group company. A legal restraint on competition is also in place.\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board are required to represent the interests of the company and must disclose any conflicts of interest without delay. They may not accept positions on the corporate bodies of any companies that compete with IMMOFINANZ.\n\nThere are no contracts between the members of the Supervisory Board or companies in which a member of the Supervisory Board holds a significant financial interest, on the one hand, and IMMOFINANZ or one of its subsidiaries, on the other hand.\n\n#### Criteria for the independence of the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Austrian Corporate Governance Code (C-Rule 53) requires the majority of the supervisory board members elected by the annual general meeting to be independent of the company and its management board. A supervisory board member is considered to be independent when he or she has no business or personal relations with the company or its management board that constitute a material conflict of interest and are therefore capable of influencing the member's behaviour.\n\nThe following independence criteria were defined by the IMMOFINANZ Supervisory Board and reflect the standards listed in Annex 1 to the Corporate Governance Code:\n\n- The Supervisory Board member did not serve as a member of the Executive Board or a key employee of IMMOFINANZ or one of its subsidiaries during the past five years.\n- The Supervisory Board member does not currently, or did not in the past year, maintain any business relations with IMMOFINANZ or one of its subsidiaries of a scope considered significant for the Supervisory Board member. The same applies to business relationships with companies in which the Supervisory Board member holds a considerable economic interest, but not to exercising functions on IMMOFINANZ's corporate bodies. The approval of individual transactions by the Supervisory Board pursuant to L-Rule 48 does not automatically qualify the member as not independent.\n- The Supervisory Board member did not act as an auditor of IMMOFINANZ or own an investment in the auditing company or work for the auditing company during the past three years.\n- The Supervisory Board member is not a member of the management board of another company in which a member of the Executive Board of IMMOFINANZ serves on the supervisory board.\n- The Supervisory Board member has not served on the Supervisory Board of IMMOFINANZ for more than 15 years. This does not apply to members who are shareholders with a direct investment in IMMOFINANZ or who represent the interests of such a shareholder.\n- The Supervisory Board member is not closely related (direct offspring, spouse, life partner, parent, uncle, aunt, sibling, niece, nephew) to a member of the Executive Board or to persons specified in one of the above points.\n\nIn accordance with C-Rule 54 of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code, Miroslava Greštiaková and Gayatri Narayan (up to 31 December 2023) are free float representatives on the Supervisory Board. These two members of the Supervisory Board are neither shareholders with a stake of more than 10% nor do they represent the interests of shareholders with a stake of more than 10%.\n\n#### Support for women on the Executive Board and Supervisory Board and in key functions\n\nIn the interest of the company, appointments to the Executive Board, Supervisory Board and key positions are based solely on professional and personal qualifications.\n\nWomen filled 32.3% of the management positions in 2023 (2022: 27.5%) and represented 59.1% of the total workforce (2022: 57.1%). One woman serves on the Executive Board. The Supervisory Board is chaired by Miroslava Greštiaková, and Gayatri Narayan was another member until 31 December 2023; the percentage of women among shareholder representatives thus remained unchanged at a high level of 50% at the reporting date. At IMMOFINANZ, women hold key management positions in central corporate functions and on the local country boards.\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional measures to increase the share of women in management positions have not been defined to date. IMMOFINANZ supports the work-life balance through flexible and partially flexible working times as well as part-time work models for employees, parental leave for fathers or the one-month \"new baby break for dads\".\n\nMen and women have equal opportunities for advancement at IMMOFINANZ, and all employees receive performance-based remuneration for their work.\n\n#### Diversity concept\n\nIMMOFINANZ does not follow an abstractly defined diversity concept for appointments to the Executive Board or Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board, which is responsible for appointments to the Executive Board and for issuing recommendations to the annual general meeting for elections to the Supervisory Board, considers the diversity aspects listed in § 243c (2) no. 2a of the Austrian Commercial Code (age, gender, education and professional experience) and the international aspects for supervisory board members which are discussed in L-Rule 52 of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code to be very important. Accordingly, these aspects are acknowledged and considered in connection with specific appointment decisions or recommendations. However, the company does not consider it suitable or expedient to tie its decisions on recommendations or appointments to a diversity concept with abstractly defined goals.\n\n#### External evaluation\n\nIMMOFINANZ's compliance with the provisions of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code was evaluated by the auditor, Ernst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H., within the framework of a separate audit of the corporate governance report (pursuant to KFS/PG 13). The related auditor's report is available for review on IMMOFINANZ's website (https://immofinanz.com). The evaluation of the corporate governance report for 2023 did not result in any objections.\n\nVienna, 27 March 2024\n\nThe Executive Board\n\nRadka Doehring Pavel Měchura\n\nPavel Měchura\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-13-0\"></span>Group Management Report\n\n## General Principles\n\nIMMOFINANZ AG is the parent company of IMMOFINANZ Group. The increase in the investment in S IMMO to 50% plus one share was completed at year-end 2022. The assets and liabilities held by S IMMO have therefore been included in IMMOFINANZ's consolidated financial statements since 31 December 2022, and the income statement positions were included beginning with the first quarter of 2023. The designation \"IMMOFINANZ Group\" is used for information that includes S IMMO, while information excluding S IMMO is referred to as \"IMMOFINANZ\".\n\nIMMOFINANZ and S IMMO have complementary portfolios and are both present in the following countries: Austria, Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Croatia. IMMOFINANZ is also active in Poland, Serbia, Slovenia and Italy. The real estate portfolios of IMMOFINANZ and S IMMO consist primarily of commercial properties in the office and retail asset classes, but S IMMO also owns hotels and residential properties.\n\n## Economic Overview and Property Markets of IMMOFINANZ Group\n\nThe following section presents a selection of key economic indicators on the core markets of IMMOFINANZ Group. Included here are statistics on GDP growth, the inflation rate and the unemployment rate based on the winter forecast published by the European Commission in February 2024 and on current Eurostat and/or OECD data. This information is followed by a summary of developments in the individual real estate market segments where IMMOFINANZ Group is active. The information was drawn from market reports prepared by BNP Paribas, CBRE, JLL, Savills and EHL (data as of the end of Q3 or Q4 2023 according to availability).\n\nThe global economy remained weak throughout 2023. Numerous political conflicts adversely affected economic activity across the world and had a negative impact on European exports. In the European Union, this climate was intensified by measures implemented to counter the high inflation – whereby actions differed between the individual member states. The Union, as a whole, was somewhat more stable than the eurozone. Year-end statistics show growth of 0.2% for the entire Union and 0.1% for the eurozone (2022: 1.7% and 1.9%, respectively). GDP forecasts point to an increase of 1.3% for the EU in 2024 and 1.7% in 2025. The estimate for the eurozone is slightly lower at 1.2% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025. The high inflation caused by the strong increase in energy prices began to decrease during the year, but after-effects slowed the price declines for energy. Inflation equalled 3.4% in the EU and 2.9% in the eurozone at year-end 2023 (2022: 10.4% and 9.2%) and remained clearly above the ECB's target of 2.0%. The rapid acceleration of economic activity might impair the fight against inflation, but branch developments will vary significantly. Inflation is projected to equal 3.5% in 2024 and 2.4% in 2025 in the European Union and 3.2% and 2.2%, respectively, in the eurozone. Stable employment and a declining demographic trend led to a drop in unemployment, which equalled 5.9% in the EU (2022: 6.1%) and a slightly higher 6.4% in the eurozone at year-end 2023 (2022: 6.7%). Demographic developments are expected to support stable employment rates in the coming years. Unemployment in the \n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\nEU is estimated at 6.0% in 2024 and 5.9% in 2025. The eurozone should follow a similar course with an expected unemployment rate of 6.6% in 2024 and a decline to 6.4% in 2025.\n\nThe transaction volume on the European real estate market fell by roughly 47% to EUR 162.3 billion in 2023 (2022: EUR 305.2 billion). The fourth quarter volume amounted to EUR 44.9 billion, for a year-on-year decline of nearly 30% but an increase of 22% over the previous quarter. In contrast to the European trend, transaction volumes in the Scandinavian countries (+105%) and Southern Europe (+85%) were significantly higher compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. A sector analysis shows a drop of 40% to 60% on average in transaction volumes (office properties: -61%; retail properties: -42%). The hotel segment proved to be more crisis resistant with a decline of only 13% in the transaction volume.\n\nA market recovery is expected in 2024 but will only become visible in the second half-year. Completed transactions show signs of a clear trend towards premium properties. The current market conditions will separate the wheat from the chaff, with a decline in the demand for second-class properties. A similar development is also apparent in the rental business: Tenants are now much more reserved when planning space than before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Austria\n\nThe Austrian economy suffered from high energy prices, rising unit labour costs and weak export activity in 2023. GDP growth in the fourth quarter was only 0.2% higher than in the previous quarter, and a review of the entire year shows a decline of 1.3% versus 2022 (2022: +4.8%). Growth rates of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively, are forecasted for 2024 and 2025. Support is expected from the lower level of inflation and resulting increase in consumer demand. Inflation eased during 2023 and equalled 5.7% at year-end (2022: 8.6%). This trend should also continue in the coming years: Inflation is projected to equal 4.1% in 2024 and 3.0% in 2025. The unemployment rate increased during 2023 and reached 5.6% at the end of December (2022: 4.9%), but a gradual reduction to 5.4% and 5.3% is forecasted for the next two years.\n\nThe transaction volume on the Austrian real estate market totalled EUR 2.8 billion in 2023 (2022: EUR 4.0 billion), for a year-on-year decline of roughly 37%. Office properties were responsible for most of this volume at EUR 1.2 billion, followed by retail properties at EUR 785 million. Prime yields rose to 5.0% (2022: 3.5%) for offices and to 5.65% (2022: 5.0%) for retail parks.\n\n#### OFFICE\n\nThe office market in Vienna had 11.6 million sqm of modern space at the end of 2023. Take-up was similar to the previous year at 174,000 sqm (2022: 171,000 sqm). New office completions dropped to 45,800 sqm (2022: 126,000 sqm). The vacancy rate fell slightly again to 3.6% (2022: 3.9%), while prime rents increased marginally to EUR 28.00/sqm/month.\n\n#### RETAIL\n\nThe Austrian retail market covered 13.6 million sqm at year-end 2023. Consumer confidence in this country was below the European average during the past year and led to noticeable restraint on the part of buyers. Offside the premium locations, retailers were faced with turnover declines. Prime rents for retail parks equalled EUR 15.0/sqm/month, and prime yields increased to 5.65% (2022: 5.0%).\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Germany\n\nHigh inflation, declining purchasing power, a changing interest environment and weak export demand had a negative impact on growth in this country during 2023. The German GDP fell by 0.2% in year-on-year comparison (2022: +1.8%). Experts see an increase in private consumption during the next two years due to the decline in inflation and stronger export demand. These two factors should support growth of 0.8% in 2024 and 1.2% in 2025. Inflation fell to 3.8% at the end of 2023 (2022: 9.6%), and expert opinions point to a continuation of this trend. Consequently, inflation could equal 3.1% in 2024 and decline further to 2.2% in 2025. The unemployment rate equalled 3.1% at year-end (2022: 2.9%), and a stable level of 3.2% is projected for the following two years.\n\nThe commercial property market in Germany reported a volume of EUR 23.3 billion in 2023 (2022: EUR 54.1 billion), which represents a year-on-year decrease of roughly 57%. Significant declines were recorded, above all, at prime locations with a minus of 67% and apparently reflect the more difficult financing conditions. The transaction volume in Düsseldorf fell to EUR 882 million (2022: EUR 2.9 billion) and, with a reduction of 69%, followed the national trend. Prime yields rose to 4.2% in Munich, followed by Berlin and Hamburg with 4.25% each (2022: Munich 3.2%; Berlin 3.2%; Hamburg 3.3%). In Düsseldorf, prime yields rose from 3.4% in the previous year to 4.5%.\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/4 description: The image shows the word \"OFFICE\" in a simple, sans-serif font. The text is light blue.\n\nDüsseldorf had 9.7 million sqm of modern office space at the end of 2023. Take-up declined by 4% to 280,000 sqm primarily due to a weak first half-year (2022: 291,000 sqm). The production of new space was slightly lower at 290,000 sqm (2022: 343,000 sqm). Despite increased rent levels, vacancies fell to 9.4% (2022: 10.9%). The interest rate hikes were responsible for an increase in prime yields to 4.5% (2022: 3.4%). Prime rents in premium properties rose to EUR 40.0/sqm/month, and average rents ranged from EUR 19.40 to EUR 20.90/sqm/ month (2022: EUR 16.50 to EUR 19.40/sqm/month).\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/6 description: A modern, curved white building with many windows is shown against a blue sky. The building has a unique design with rounded edges and a wave-like shape. The windows are rectangular and evenly spaced across the facade. The building appears to be an office building or apartment complex.\n\n## Romania\n\nExperts' forecasts place growth for the Romanian economy in 2023 at 2.2% (2022: 5.0%). The sharp rise in energy and food prices weakened purchasing power and had a negative effect on economic momentum. The next two years are expected to bring an improvement in purchasing power and renewed growth of 3.1% and 3.4%. Inflation dropped to 7.0% at the end of the year (2022: 12.0%) but remained above the eurozone level. Declining prices should reduce inflation to 5.9% in 2024 and 3.4% in 2025. In spite of the challenging economic conditions, the unemployment rate in Romania was stable and equalled 5.4% at yearend (2022: 5.6%). The employment situation should remain constant with an unemployment rate of 5.2% and 5.3% in the coming two years.\n\nWith transactions totalling EUR 499 million (2022: EUR 1.3 billion), the volume on the Romanian commercial property market fell by more than 60% in 2023. The retail segment was responsible for most of the transactions with a market share of roughly 57% or EUR 284 million. Office property transactions declined to a market share of 17% or EUR 85 million. Prime yields for shopping centers rose by 50 basis points to 7.75% (2022: 7.25%) and for office properties by 75 basis points to 7.75% (2022: 7.0%).\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### OFFIC RETAIL\n\nThe office market in Bucharest had 3.41 million sqm of modern space at year-end 2023. Completions totalled 110,000 sqm (2022: 124,400 sqm) and, at the time this report was prepared, a further 16,100 sqm were under construction. Take-up rose by 62% to 476,000 sqm (2022: 295,300 sqm), and vacancies increased to 14.7% at the end of December (2022: 14.1%). Prime rents in the city center equalled EUR 19.5/sqm/month.\n\nRomania had 4.34 million sqm of modern retail space at the time this report was prepared. The properties completed in 2023 had a combined total of 251,000 sqm (2022: 86,700 sqm), whereby 87% represented locations outside the Bucharest metropolitan region. An additional 258,000 sqm (2022: 265,000 sqm) of retail space are currently under construction and should be completed in 2024. Rents in the high-turnover locations rose by 7%. Prime rents equalled EUR 80.0/sqm/month in shopping centers and EUR 8.0 to EUR 15.0/sqm/month in retail parks.\n\n### Poland\n\nEconomic growth was limited to 0.4% by high inflation and weak export activity in 2023 (2022: 4.9%), but a trend reversal is expected in 2024. Forecasts show an increase to 2.7% and further recovery to 3.2% by 2025. Inflation had fallen to 6.2% by the end of 2023 (2022: 13.2%) and is expected to remain at this level in 2024 but decrease to 3.8% in the following year due to a decline in energy and food prices. The Polish labour market is still characterised by scarce supply. The unemployment rate equalled 2.7% at year-end (2022: 2.9%) and should fluctuate only slightly in the next two years with 2.8% and 2.7%.\n\nThe commercial real estate market in Poland recorded a sharp drop of 65% to EUR 2.1 billion in 2023 (2022: EUR 5.9 billion). Industrial and logistics properties generated the highest transaction volume with a market share of 46% or EUR 965 million (2022: EUR 2.0 billion). Transactions in retail properties fell by nearly 70% to EUR 430 million (2022: EUR 1.5 billion) and a market share of 21%. Office properties ranked third with a decline of 79% to EUR 429 million (2022: EUR 2.1 billion) and a market share of 21%. Yields increased to 6.0% (2022: 5.25%) for office properties and to 6.5% (2022: 6.25%) for retail properties. Retail park yields equalled 7.25%.\n\n#### OFFICE\n\nOffice space totalling 61,000 sqm was completed on the Warsaw office market in 2023 (2022: 232,000 sqm). That represents the lowest level since 2010 and brought the total supply to 6.2 million sqm. An additional 238,000 sqm were under construction at the time this report was prepared. Take-up declined by 13% to 748,800 sqm in 2023 (2022: 860,000 sqm). Vacancies fell to 10.4% (2022: 11.6%) by the end of the year, and prime rents in the Warsaw city center rose to EUR 29.0/sqm/month.\n\n#### RETAIL\n\nThe supply of retail space grew by 563,400 sqm in 2023 (2022: 360,000 sqm), whereby 63% is attributable to the retail park segment. Poland had 13.8 million sqm of modern retail space at the end of the year; a further 430,000 sqm (2022: 350,000 sqm) are currently under construction and should be completed in 2024. Prime rents in the retail parks were stable and ranged from EUR 9.5 to EUR 12.0/sqm/month.\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Slovakia\n\nThe Slovakian economy grew by 1.3% in 2023 (2022: 1.7%) according to the experts, notwithstanding the high inflation. This development was based on a high level of investments and extensive exports to the neighbouring European countries. In line with this trend, Slovakia could generate growth of 1.7% and 2.0% in the next two years. Inflation equalled 6.6% at the end of December 2023 (2022: 12.1%) and is forecasted to decline to 5.2% in 2024 and to 3.0% in 2025. The unemployment rate reflected the previous year with 5.8% at year-end (2022: 5.8%) and could decrease to 5.4% and 5.2% in the coming two years due to an improvement in the overall economic situation.\n\nThe transaction volume on the commercial investment market in Slovakia fell by 41% to EUR 664 million in 2023 (2022: EUR 1.1 billion). Office properties were the main driver with a market share of 70% or EUR 467 million (2022: EUR 624 million), followed ex aequo by retail properties with 14% or EUR 93 million (2022: EUR 350 million) and industrial and logistics properties with 14% or EUR 93 million (2022: EUR 147 million). Prime yields increased to 6.0% (2022: 5.5%) in the office segment and to 6.5% (2022: 6.3%) for shopping centers.\n\n#### OFFICE\n\nThe market for modern office properties in Bratislava covered 2.1 million sqm at the end of 2023. Completions totalled 114,000 sqm, with a significant decline in the space under construction to 21,000 sqm (2022: 119,000 sqm). The vacancy rate rose noticeably to 14.2% (2022: 11.2%) and turnover amounted to 183,500 sqm. Prime rents increased from EUR 17.0 to EUR 18.0/sqm/month. Average rents followed this trend and equalled EUR 15.50/sqm/ month at year-end.\n\n#### RETAIL\n\nThe supply of retail space in Slovakia remained nearly unchanged in year-on-year comparison at 2.4 million sqm in 2023 (2022: 2.4 million sqm). A total of 76,000 sqm are currently under development (2022: 100,000 sqm). The high inflation rate was reflected in rental price adjustments during the past year. Prime rents equalled EUR 67.0/sqm/month for shopping centers in Bratislava and EUR 15.0/sqm/month for retail parks. Prime yields rose by 20 basis points to 6.5% for shopping centers and by 35 basis points to 7.15% for retail parks.\n\n## Czech Republic\n\nThe Czech economy virtually stagnated in 2023 with a decline of 0.2% (2022: +2.5%). Growth was slowed by measures introduced to reduce inflation and weak economic development in the neighbouring countries. Friendlier market conditions should support an increase of 1.4% in 2024 and further sound recovery to 3.0% in 2025. Inflation equalled 7.6% at the end of 2023 (2022: 14.8%) and should drop to 3.2% in 2024 due to a decline in energy prices before falling to 2.4% in 2025. The labour shortage in the Czech Republic was still visible at year-end. The unemployment rate equalled 2.8% at the end of December 2023 (2022: 2.3%) and should remain stable at 2.5% in each of the coming two years.\n\nThe transaction market in the Czech Republic declined by 16% to a volume of EUR 1.4 billion in 2023 (2022: EUR 1.6 billion), whereby the traditionally strong fourth quarter proved to be disappointing. Retail properties were the most popular asset class in the last 12 months with a share of 45%, followed by office properties at 26%. Prime yields increased from 4.8% to 5.4% for office properties and from 6.25% to 6.3% for retail properties.\n\n{18}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### OFFICE\n\nThe office market in Prague had roughly 3.9 million sqm of modern space at the end of 2023. Completions totalled 98,400 sqm, and an additional 100,000 sqm (2022: 293,600 sqm) were under construction at the time this report was prepared. Takeup reflected the previous year at 541,900 sqm (2022: 550,100 sqm), and the vacancy rate declined to 7.2% (2022: 7.7%) due to the limited construction activity. Prime rents increased to EUR 27.5/sqm/ month, and average rents at good locations ranged from EUR 17.75 to EUR 18.25/sqm/month. Prime yields rose to 5.4%.\n\n#### RETAIL\n\nThe supply of retail space remained constant during the past year and totalled roughly 2.5 million sqm at year-end. A total of 24,000 sqm are currently under construction. 18 months of declining retail turnover ended with a trend reversal in November 2023. Rising interest rates led to an increase of 10 basis points in prime yields to 6.35% for shopping centers as well as retail parks.\n\n### Hungary\n\nForecasts indicate a continuation of the recession in Hungary during 2023, which led to a GDP decline of 0.7% (2022: +4.9%). This development was a result of high inflation combined with tax and monetary measures. However, recovery is expected in 2024 with growth of 2.4% and a further increase to 3.6% in 2025. Inflation had fallen to 5.5% by the end of the year (2022: 15.3%) and, consistent with this trend, should decline further to 5.2% in 2024 and to 4.1% in 2025. The unemployment rate equalled 4.2% at the end of the year (2022: 4.0%) and should remain relatively constant at 4.2% and 4.1% in the next two years.\n\nThe transaction volume on the commercial real estate market in Hungary fell by 69% to EUR 441 million in 2023 (2022: EUR 1.4 billion). Prime yields rose to 6.75% (2022: 6.0%) for office properties, to 6.0% (2022: 5.75%) for shopping centers and to 7.25% (2022: 6.5%) for retail parks.\n\n#### OFFICE\n\nThe office market in Budapest has 4.5 million sqm of modern space. Take-up fell by 10% to 352,000 sqm in 2023 (2022: 391,700 sqm). Completions totalled 180,000 sqm (2022: 247,000 sqm), and a further 180,000 sqm are currently under construction. The vacancy rate rose to 13.3% as a result of the new completions (2022: 11.3%). Average rents were slightly higher at EUR 14.2/sqm/month, and prime rents equalled EUR 25.0/sqm/month.\n\n#### RETAIL\n\nRetail turnover fell by 10% in 2023, primarily due to the high inflation. Completions totalled 10,300 sqm, and a further 27,000 sqm are in the development pipeline. Consequently, the supply of space will also be limited in the coming years and should generally lead to an increase in rents. Prime yields for shopping centers rose slightly to 6.0%.\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Adriatic\n\nIMMOFINANZ's Adriatic region includes Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia and Italy. The economies in these countries followed the European trend with growth ranging from 2.6% in Croatia to 0.7% in Italy. Serbia is expected to generate the strongest growth in the coming years with an increase of 3.1% in 2024 and 3.7% in 2025. Italy trails behind with expected growth of 0.9% in 2024 and 1.2% in 2025. The inflation rate equalled 8.1% in Croatia, followed by 7.5% in Slovenia and 6.1% in Italy at the end of 2023. Slovenia will presumably take longest for inflation to subside: The inflation rate is projected to equal 3.9% in 2024 and 2.4% in 2025. Unemployment was highest in Serbia with 9.4% at the end of the year. A dynamic reduction in unemployment is forecasted for Serbia and Croatia – down to 8.6% in Serbia in the next two years and from 6.5% in 2023 to 5.8% in Croatia. The labour markets in Slovenia and Italy have shown sidewards development, whereby Slovenia's unemployment rate should remain at a low 3.6%. According to the experts, Italy will only be able to marginally reduce its traditionally high unemployment to 7.3%.\n\nAmong the commercial property markets in this region, Italy is by far the most important. It declined by 49% to a transaction volume of EUR 6.1 billion in 2023 (2022: EUR 11.7 billion). Prime yields in Italy rose by 35 basis points to 4.25% (2022: 3.9%) for offices and by 1.2 percentage points to 7.5% (2022: 6.3%) for shopping centers. Prime yields in Serbia were uniform at 8.75% (2022: 8.0%) and, in Croatia, equalled 7.3% (2022: 6.8%) for retail properties and 8.3% (2022: 7.8%) for offices. In Slovenia, the prime yields for retail properties equalled 7.8% (2022: 7.3%).\n\n### Hotels\n\nThe Austrian hotel market continued along a recovery course in 2023. With nearly 151 million overnight stays, the record 2019 level was only just missed. Indicators reflected a similar level to 2022for domestic travellers in 2023, while growth was driven mainly by the return of international tourists. This segment increased by 13.5% year-on-year. According to CBRE, steady growth in overnight stays can be expected in 2024 – above all from overseas travellers.\n\nThe hotel market in the CEE region also recorded positive development, supported by the increasing recovery of tourism. This trend can be expected to continue.\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-20-0\"></span>Portfolio Report\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group concentrates on its core business as a growth-oriented property owner and on the continuous optimisation of its portfolio.

In this way, IMMOFINANZ Group is also optimally positioned to meet the future needs of tenants and consumers in the retail business and tenants and their staffs in the office sector.\n\n### The IMMOFINANZ Group's property portfolio\n\nThe IMMOFINANZ Group's property portfolio (IMMOFINANZ including S IMMO) included 518 properties<sup>\\*</sup> with a combined value<sup>\\*</sup> of EUR 8,174.3 million as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 627 properties with a carrying amount of EUR 8,363.8 million). Standing investments<sup>\\*</sup> represented the largest component at EUR 7,840.2 million, or 95.9% of the carrying amount, and 3.6 million sqm of rentable space<sup>\\*</sup> which generate steady rental income. Development projects<sup>\\*</sup> are responsible for EUR 138.3 million, or 1.7% of the carrying amount. A carrying amount of EUR 195.8 million, or 2.4%, is attributable to pipeline projects<sup>\\*</sup> and includes future planned development projects, undeveloped land and real estate inventories. The owner-operated S IMMO hotels (Vienna Marriott, Budapest Marriott and Novotel Bucharest City Center) with 61,075 sqm of total rentable space are not included in this portfolio report.\n\nThe application of IFRS 16 since the first quarter of 2019 leads to differences between the amounts presented in the portfolio report and on the balance sheet. Expert appraisals or internal valuation form the basis for the property values in the portfolio report. The reported property values on the balance sheet also include capitalised rights of use for building rights.\n\nThe presentation in the portfolio report is based on the primary use of the properties.\n\n| Property portfolio | Number of<br>properties | Standing<br>investments<br>in MEUR | Development<br>projects<br>in MEUR | Pipeline<br>projects<br>in MEUR1 | Property<br>portfolio<br>in MEUR | Property<br>portfolio<br>in % |\n|--------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Austria            | 20                      | 381.7                              | 0.0                                | 9.2                              | 390.9                            | 4.8                           |\n| Germany            | 5                       | 467.6                              | 0.0                                | 4.5                              | 472.1                            | 5.8                           |\n| Poland             | 29                      | 936.9                              | 28.5                               | 0.0                              | 965.4                            | 11.8                          |\n| Czech Republic     | 72                      | 933.6                              | 0.0                                | 0.0                              | 933.6                            | 11.4                          |\n| Hungary            | 19                      | 224.8                              | 0.0                                | 2.7                              | 227.5                            | 2.8                           |\n| Romania            | 32                      | 595.8                              | 65.1                               | 72.0                             | 732.9                            | 9.0                           |\n| Slovakia           | 35                      | 428.1                              | 0.0                                | 1.3                              | 429.4                            | 5.3                           |\n| Adriatic2          | 62                      | 584.9                              | 28.0                               | 34.6                             | 647.6                            | 7.9                           |\n| S IMMO             | 244                     | 3,286.8                            | 16.7                               | 71.5                             | 3,375.0                          | 41.3                          |\n| IMMOFINANZ Group   | 518                     | 7,840.2                            | 138.3                              | 195.8                            | 8,174.3                          | 100.0                         |\n| in %               |                         | 95.9                               | 1.7                                | 2.4                              | 100.0                            |                               |\n\n#### The IMMOFINANZ Group property portfolio by core market and classification\n\n1 Including real estate inventories\n\n2 In declining order based on the carrying amount: Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia and Italy\n\n<sup>∗</sup> Including properties held by IMMOFINANZ Group that are held for sale and fall under IFRS 5 (31 December 2023: EUR 255.9 million;

These properties are located, above all, in the core markets of Austria, Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Adriatic (Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia and Italy). Standing investments<sup>\\*</sup> represent the largest component at EUR 4,553.4 million, or 94.9% of the carrying amount, and 2.1 million sqm of rentable space<sup>\\*</sup>. Development projects<sup>\\*</sup> are responsible for EUR 121.6 million, or 2.5% of the carrying amount. A carrying amount of EUR 124.3 million, or 2.6%, is attributable to pipeline projects<sup>\\*</sup>.\n\n#### Acquisitions and sales by IMMOFINANZ\n\nIMMOFINANZ continued the strategic expansion of its high-yield retail portfolio during 2023 by acquiring 22 complementary retail properties in the Czech Republic during the fourth quarter and, in a second step, a retail park and a shopping center from CPI Property Group (CPIPG). These properties have nearly 107,300 sqm of rentable space in total, are almost fully rented, and generate approximately EUR 17 million (gross) of annual rental income. The combined property value amounted to roughly EUR 237 million. These transactions will strengthen IMMOFINANZ's earning power and position on the attractive Czech retail market.\n\nProperty sales (including S IMMO) totalled EUR 751.1 million in 2023. Included here, among others, are the Bureau am Belvedere office building in Vienna with nearly 9,000 sqm as well as land in Romania and in Turkey. Other sales involved transactions by S IMMO in Germany and an office property in Croatia.\n\nIn February 2023, IMMOFINANZ signed a letter of intent to sell several office properties at the location on Vienna's Wienerberg to S IMMO. This transaction covered six standing investments with roughly 128,000 sqm of rentable space and one development project which was opened in the third quarter of 2023. The transaction volume totalled approximately EUR 411 million.\n\nThis agreement included the sale by IMMOFINANZ of the Vienna Twin Towers office building to S IMMO in July 2023. The agreement with S IMMO was completed with the sale of five further office properties and one hotel building in October 2023. The IMMOFINANZ team remains in charge of the administration and rental of the properties at the Wienerberg location, most of which operate under the innovative myhive brand.\n\nAs IMMOFINANZ holds a controlling interest of 50% plus one share in S IMMO, this transaction will have no effect on the Group's asset, financial or earnings position.\n\nIn addition, IMMOFINANZ sold the Grand Center Zagreb office building to a Croatian property company and two office properties in Vienna to an Austrian real estate investor after the reporting period in the first quarter 2024.\n\n<sup>\\*</sup> Including properties held by IMMOFINANZ that are held for sale and fall under IFRS 5 (31 December 2023: EUR 171.4 million; see section 4.10 in the consolidated financial statements for details).\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\n## The S IMMO property portfolio\n\nThe S IMMO property portfolio (excluding owner-operated hotel properties) included 244 properties as of 31 December 2023. These properties had a combined carrying amount of EUR 3,375.0 million (31 December 2022: 362 properties with a carrying amount of EUR 3,164.2 million) and rentable space of 1.4 million sqm (31 December 2022: 1.4 million sqm).\n\nFor further information on the property portfolio, see the S IMMO AG annual report as of 31 December 2023.\n\n## The IMMOFINANZ Group's standing investments\n\nThe IMMOFINANZ Group's standing investment portfolio includes 432 properties. Acquisitions and the completion of development projects more than offset strategic sales, and the carrying amount of the portfolio totalled EUR 7,840.2 million as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 530 properties with a carrying amount of EUR 7,936.0 million). Of this total, 24.4% are attributable to office properties, 33.5% to retail properties and 41.9% to S IMMO. The focal point of the standing investments by segments based on the carrying amount are the markets in Poland (EUR 936.9 million), the Czech Republic (EUR 933.6 million) and Romania (EUR 595.8 million) as well as S IMMO (EUR 3,286.8 million). The rentable space in this portfolio totalled 3.6 million sqm. The standing investment portfolio had a gross return of 7.2% based on IFRS rental income, whereby rental incentives – e.g. the standard market practice of granting rent-free periods or allowances for fit-out costs – are accrued on a straight-line basis over the contract term in accordance with IFRS. The occupancy rate equalled 92.2% (31 December 2022: 92.9%).\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### The IMMOFINANZ Group's standing investments by core market\n\n| Standing

carrying amount of EUR 4,553.4 million as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 208 standing investments with a carrying amount of EUR 4,852.1 million). Of this total, 42.0% are attributable to office properties and 57.7% to retail properties. The rentable space totalled 2.1 million sqm (31 December 2022: 2.2 million sqm). The properties in this portfolio have a gross return of 7.5% based on IFRS rental income.\n\n#### Occupancy rate increased to 95.6%\n\nThe occupancy rate increased to 95.6% (31 December 2022: 94.3%). According to the EPRA's calculation formula, the vacancy rate equalled 5.1% (31 December 2022: 6.5%). The EPRA vacancy rate is based on the ratio of the estimated market rent for the vacant space in the standing investments to the total estimated market rent for the standing investment portfolio. Take-up in the standing investments and development projects (excluding standing investments in the Other asset class) amounted to 374,300 sqm in 2023 (2022: 317,300 sqm). This take-up includes roughly 129,400 sqm of new rentals and roughly 244,900 sqm of contract extensions. The average unexpired lease term weighted by rental income (WAULT<sup>\\*</sup>) equalled 3.6 years as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 3.5 years).\n\n#### Contract expiration profile for IMMOFINANZ: standing investments (total)\n\nFixed-term contracts until the end of the term and open-ended contracts as of the earliest possible exit date in relation to the total rented space (in GLA space1, excluding S IMMO):\n\n| 1 year in % | 2 years in % | 3 years in % | 4 years in % | 5 years in % | > 5 years in % | > 10 years in % |\n|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| 14          | 13           | 17           | 12           | 16           | 19             | 7               |\n\n1 Gross lettable area: the total area available to tenants for their exclusive use; excludes common areas, e.g. traffic, parking and service areas, etc.\n\n#### Sustainability certification\n\nThe certified space totalled roughly 958,800 sqm at the end of December 2023 in buildings with a combined carrying amount of EUR 2.6 billion. Sustainability certificates have therefore been issued for 57.5% of the carrying amount, respectively 44.7% of the total space in the standing investment portfolio. In the office business, certification covered 90.4% of the properties based on the carrying amount and 77.3% of the total space.\n\n#### Further sound growth of 8.5% in like-for-like rental income for IMMOFINANZ\n\nA like-for-like analysis (i.e. acquisitions, completions and sales are deducted to facilitate comparison with earlier periods) shows a further improvement of 8.5%, or EUR 22.9 million, to EUR 292.3 million in 2023, after EUR 269.5 million in the previous year. Positive development was reported by all core markets. The driving factors included, among others, the indexing of rents and higher turnover-based rents in the retail properties.\n\n<sup>∗</sup> Weighted Average Unexpired Lease Term: The calculation for fixed-term contracts is based on the term or – where available – the time up to the break option (special cancellation right for tenants). For open-ended contracts, the remaining term equals at least two years or a longer period if the break option is later than this twoyear period.\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### IMMOFINANZ's standing office investments\n\nThe carrying amount of the 31 standing office investments held by IMMOFINANZ (excluding S IMMO) totalled EUR 1,912.5 million as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 40 standing investments with a carrying amount of EUR 2,537.1 million). These assets represented 42.0% of the standing investment portfolio and 34.7% of the rental income from standing investments in the fourth quarter of 2023. The occupancy rate in the office portfolio equalled 88.4% at the end of December (31 December 2022: 88.1%). The take-up for standing investments and development projects in the office business totalled roughly 162,700 sqm in 2023 (2022: 144,800 sqm), with 60,400 sqm related to new rentals and 102,300 sqm to contract extensions.\n\nThe tenant structure of the office portfolio remains balanced. The ten largest tenants occupy 27.1% of the space in the office standing investments, and no single tenant has rented more than 4.6% of the total space in these properties (31 December 2022: 21.6% and 3.6%). The WAULT<sup>\\*</sup> equalled 3.5 years as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 3.6 years).\n\n#### Contract expiration profile: IMMOFINANZ standing office investments\n\nFixed-term contracts until the end of the term and open-ended contracts as of the earliest possible exit date in relation to the total rented space (in GLA space1; excluding S IMMO):\n\n| 1 year in % | 2 years in % | 3 years in % | 4 years in % | 5 years in % | > 5 years in % | > 10 years in % |\n|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| 19          | 12           | 15           | 9            | 17           | 20             | 9               |\n\n1 Gross lettable area: the total area available to tenants for their exclusive use; excludes common areas, e.g. traffic, parking and service areas, etc.\n\nAn overview of the IMMOFINANZ office properties can be found under https://immofinanz.com/en/office/office-search.\n\n#### Key data on the IMMOFINANZ standing office investments by category\n\n| Standing investments | Number of<br>properties | Carrying amount<br>in MEUR | Carrying amount<br>in % | Rentable space<br>in sqm | Rented space<br>in sqm | Occupancy rate<br>in % |\n|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| IMMOFINANZ           | 31                      | 1,912.5                    | 100.0                   | 633,479                  | 559,873                | 88.4                   |\n| thereof myhive       | 17                      | 1,041.0                    | 54.4                    | 385,428                  | 347,528                | 90.2                   |\n| thereof office other | 14                      | 871.5                      | 45.6                    | 248,051                  | 212,345                | 85.6                   |\n\n| Standing investments | Rental income<br>Q4 2023 in MEUR | Gross return in % | Carrying amount<br>financing in MEUR | Financing costs<br>incl. derivatives<br>in % | LTV in % |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------|\n| IMMOFINANZ           | 29.5                             | 6.2               | 925.2                                | 2.8                                          | 48.4     |\n| thereof myhive       | 16.7                             | 6.4               | 478.2                                | 2.3                                          | 45.9     |\n| thereof office other | 12.8                             | 5.9               | 447.0                                | 3.3                                          | 51.3     |\n\n<sup>\\*</sup> Weighted Average Unexpired Lease Term: The calculation for fixed-term contracts is based on the term or – where available – the time up to the break option (special cancellation right for tenants).

These properties represented 57.7% of the standing investment portfolio and generated 65.0% of the rental income from standing investments in the fourth quarter of 2023. The occupancy rate equalled a high 98.7% as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 98.8%). The occupancy rates in the STOP SHOP/retail parks and VIVO! shopping centers equalled 99.0% and 97.3%, respectively. Take-up for the standing investments and development projects in the retail business totalled roughly 211,600 sqm in 2023 (2022: 172,500 sqm), whereby roughly 69,000 sqm were attributable to new rentals and 142,600 sqm to contract extensions.\n\nIMMOFINANZ relies on a balanced tenant mix to create an optimal environment for retailers and their customers. All larger retail properties have solid international and local anchor tenants, but no single retailer has rented more than 4.1% of the total space in these properties. The WAULT<sup>\\*</sup> equalled 3.5 years as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 3.5 years).\n\n#### Branch mix – Retail\n\nOnly rented space in the IMMOFINANZ standing investments as of 31 December 2023\n\nImage /page/27/Figure/6 description: This image is a horizontal bar chart showing the percentage of different categories.

For open-ended contracts, the remaining term equals at least two years or a longer period if the break option is later than this twoyear period.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/28/Figure/1 description: This image shows a map of Europe with several countries highlighted in gray.

The STOP SHOP retail park in Đakovo opened in November 2023.\n\n#### Romania\n\nThe myhive Victoria Park, an existing office property in Bucharest, underwent extensive modernisation and integration in the flexible myhive office concept. The project was completed in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\n## The IMMOFINANZ Group's pipeline projects\n\nPipeline projects include future planned development projects, undeveloped land and/or temporarily suspended projects. These projects had a carrying amount of EUR 195.8 million as of 31 December 2023 and represent 2.4% of the IMMOFINANZ Group's total portfolio. Of this total, EUR 124.3 million, or 2.6%, are attributable to IMMOFINANZ, excluding S IMMO (31 December 2022: EUR 159.3 million, or 3.1%). S IMMO is responsible for EUR 71.5 million. The focal point of the IMMOFINANZ Group's pipeline projects is Romania with a volume of EUR 72.0 million. IMMOFINANZ Group plans to further reduce the scope of its pipeline projects – especially the land reserves in Romania – through strategic sales.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-31-0\"></span>Property Valuation\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and arranges for the regular appraisal of its properties by independent experts. This external valuation is carried out at least once every year as of 31 December and reflects the EPRA's Best Practices Policy Recommendations for the application of the fair value method as defined in IFRS.\n\nThe valuation includes property-related factors like the occupancy rate, rental income and the length of the rental contracts as well as the age and quality of the buildings. External factors are also taken into account, e.g. the development of the regional and general market environments, the economy and the financing climate. ESG aspects such as the risks arising from climate change, energy efficiency and the social added value of the properties are also examined and the potential impact on property values in the future are identified. CBRE, an independent company, was responsible for appraising 55.8% of IMMOFINANZ Group's portfolio (EUR 8.2 billion) as of 31 December 2023. S IMMO and its valuation covered 41.3%, and only 2.9% were valued internally by IMMOFINANZ Group.\n\n#### IMMOFINANZ Group: development of property valuation in 2023\n\nTotal revaluations (including property development and property sales) for IMMOFINANZ Group equalled EUR -376.8 million in 2023 (2022: EUR -105.7 million) and reflect the challenging market environment with its sharp rise in interest rates and continuing high construction costs. The revaluation results for investment property (standing investments and land reserves) amounted to EUR -352.0 million, compared with EUR -110.5 million in the previous year. The S IMMO portfolio was responsible for -3.5% of the carrying amount. The IMMOFINANZ office properties recorded valuation declines of EUR -242.3 million, or -13.4% of the carrying amount as of 31 December 2023, whereby the largest individual effects were recorded from office buildings in Düsseldorf, Vienna and Warsaw. Revaluation increases in the retail segment equalled EUR 5.0 million, or 0.2% of the carrying amount, and are mainly attributable to the acquisitions made in the Czech Republic in the fourth quarter.\n\n| Investment property | Carrying amount in MEUR | Valuation effects 2023 in MEUR | Ratio of valuation to carrying amount in %

The best possible structuring of debt financing is an important priority and, in addition to successful property management, represents a decisive factor for the results generated by the company's business activities.\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group had a robust balance sheet structure with an equity ratio of 47.3% as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 47.9%) and a solid net loan-to-value ratio (net LTV) of 42.1% (31 December 2022: 40.7%). The financial liabilities<sup>∗</sup> held by IMMOFINANZ Group totalled EUR 4.2 billion as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 4.2 billion). Cash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 697.1 million (including cash and cash equivalents in assets held for sale). Net debt, i.e. debt after the deduction of cash and cash equivalents, equalled EUR 3.5 billion (31 December 2022: EUR 3.5 billion).\n\n#### Development of net LTV in IMMOFINANZ Group\n\nImage /page/33/Figure/6 description: This line graph shows percentage values on the y axis from 30% to 50% and six data points along the x axis.

Therefore, floating rate liabilities that are hedged with a swap can be regarded as fixed interest rate liabilities from an economic standpoint.\n\nThe interest rates used for discounting and the calculation of variable payment flows are based on interest rate curves for each currency and matching maturities that are observable on the market. In accordance with IFRS 13 (Fair Value Measurement), the resulting market values are adjusted to include a credit value adjustment (CVA) and a debt value adjustment (DVA).\n\n#### Financial liabilities held by IMMOFINANZ Group – type of interest rate as of 31 December 2023\n\nImage /page/36/Figure/4 description: This image shows a horizontal bar chart that represents interest rates.

This rating and outlook were confirmed during the annual review process in January 2022. The rating was raised to BBB (outlook: negative) in June 2022 based on IMMOFINANZ's membership in CPI Property Group (CPIPG). In October 2022, CPIPG's rating was adjusted to BBB- (outlook: stable), and IMMOFINANZ AG's rating also changed to BBB- (outlook: stable). IMMOFINANZ withdrew its individual rating for efficiency reasons in March 2023 due to its group affiliation to CPIPG.\n\nIn connection with the issue of the corporate bond 2020–2027, IMMOFINANZ has committed to comply with the following standard financial covenants. These covenants are calculated on the basis of the consolidated IFRS financial statements:\n\n| Financial covenant               | Threshold in % | Value as of 31 12 2023 in % |\n|----------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------|\n| Net Debt to Value Ratio1         | Max. 60.0      | 41.3                        |\n| Secured Net Debt to Value Ratio1 | Max. 45.0      | 31.9                        |\n| Interest Coverage Ratio          | Min. 150.0     | 245.6                       |\n\n1 The values are based on the latest calculation as per the bond terms on or before 31 December 2023.\n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-37-0\"></span>Business Development\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group generated strong growth in rental income and operating results in 2023. This sound development was supported, above all, by the full consolidation of S IMMO and the acquisition of retail properties as well as a substantial improvement in like-for-like rental income. Rental income rose by roughly 78% yearon-year to EUR 533.6 million, and the results of asset management were even 85.1% higher than the previous year at EUR 418.5 million. The results of property sales amounted to EUR -38.3 million (2022: EUR 4.6 million) and were influenced primarily by the reclassification to profit or loss of historical foreign exchange effects following the deconsolidation of a subsidiary in Turkey during the second quarter of 2023 (EUR -45.8 million). The results of operations increased substantially by nearly 85% to EUR 285.1 million in spite of this effect.\n\nRevaluations (including property development and property sales) totalled EUR -376.8 million, compared with EUR -105.7 million in the previous year. This reduction reflects the challenging market environment, which is influenced by the sharp rise in interest rates. Financial results declined to EUR -246.1 million (2022: EUR -72.6 million), primarily due to the absence of positive non-cash valuation effects from 2022. In addition, the earnings contributions from S IMMO are no longer included under financial results due to the full consolidation. Net profit recorded by IMMOFINANZ Group for the 2023 financial year therefore decreased to EUR -229.5 million and earnings per share equalled EUR -1.31.\n\n### Income statement\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                       |          |         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|\n|                                                           | 2023     | 2022    |\n| Rental income                                             | 533,601  | 300,170 |\n| Results of asset management                               | 418,538  | 226,103 |\n| Results of owner-operated hotel properties                | 2,012    | 0       |\n| Results of property sales                                 | -38,327  | 4,623   |\n| Results of property development                           | -25,591  | -20,684 |\n| Other operating income                                    | 7,853    | 10,377  |\n| Other operating expenses                                  | -79,367  | -66,078 |\n| Results of operations                                     | 285,118  | 154,341 |\n| Revaluation result from standing investments and goodwill | -352,207 | 103,974 |\n| Operating profit (EBIT)                                   | -67,089  | 258,315 |\n| Financial results                                         | -246,059 | -72,617 |\n| Earnings before tax (EBT)                                 | -313,148 | 185,698 |\n| Net profit or loss                                        | -229,461 | 141,969 |\n\nRental income recorded by IMMOFINANZ Group rose by 77.8% to EUR 533.6 million in 2023. This increase is chiefly attributable to the full consolidation of S IMMO and the acquisition of retail properties as well as a substantial 8.5% increase in like-for-like rental income. The improvement in the results of asset management exceeded the increase in rental income with a plus of 85.1% to EUR 418.5 million (2022: EUR 226.1 million).\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group continued its strategic property sales in 2023 with a volume of EUR 751.1 million. These sales consisted primarily of strategic transactions by S IMMO in Germany and an office property in Croatia as well as the sale of a Vienna office property and land in Turkey and in Romania by IMMOFINANZ. The results of property sales amounted to EUR -38.3 million (2022: EUR 4.6 million), whereby a negative earnings effect of EUR -45.8 million resulted from the deconsolidation of a subsidiary in Turkey during the second quarter of 2023 (2022: EUR 5.4 million). This negative element resulted almost entirely from the reclassification to profit or loss of historical foreign exchange effects due to the devaluation of the Turkish lira since the initial consolidation. These foreign exchange effects were previously recorded under comprehensive income without recognition to profit or loss. A contrasting factor was a purchase price receivable of EUR 7.0 million which was recognised in 2023 financial year and was paid in 2024. It resulted from the sale of the Russian portfolio in 2017 and was scheduled for settlement in the first half of 2022. Due to the war in Ukraine and the related sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation together with the related effects – especially the payment restrictions imposed in Russia – management viewed this receivable as presumably uncollectible and the receivable was subsequently written off in full at EUR -12.9 million in 2022.\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe results of property development amounted to EUR -25.6 million (2022: EUR -20.7 million) and reflected market trends and rising construction costs.\n\n#### Results of operations\n\nOther operating expenses rose to EUR -79.4 million (2022: EUR -66.1 million), mainly due to the full consolidation of S IMMO, the outsourcing of various activities to the service companies of CPI Property Group together with the related management fees that cannot be directly allocated to asset management, and to provisions for legal disputes in Romania. Legal, audit and consulting fees declined from EUR -19.4 million in 2022 to EUR - 13.9 million in 2023. This reduction reflected the absence of expenses recognised in 2022 for a Group-wide digitalisation project and expenses related to the takeover offers by CPI Property Group and S IMMO.\n\nThe results of operations increased by a substantial 84.7% to EUR 285.1 million (2022: EUR 154.3 million).\n\n#### Valuation results and EBIT\n\nResults from the valuation of standing investments and goodwill reflected the general market trends and turned negative at EUR -352.2 million, compared with EUR 104.0 million in the previous year. The decline in IMMOFINANZ Group's portfolio equalled -4.5% of the carrying amount as of 31 December 2023. Negative valuation results were responsible for a decrease in operating profit (EBIT) to EUR -67.1 million (2022: EUR 258.3 million) despite the strong operating results recorded in 2023.\n\n#### Financial results\n\nFinancing costs rose to EUR -210.0 million (2022: EUR -77.8 million), chiefly due to the full consolidation of S IMMO as well as an increase in financing costs. Other financial results fell to EUR -119.5 million (2022: EUR 149.1 million) based on the non-cash valuation of interest rate derivatives which followed the decline in long-term eurozone interest rates during 2023. The settlement payments from derivatives were, in contrast, positive and made an important contribution to financing income of EUR 92.0 million (2022: EUR 5.6 million). As the investment in S IMMO is no longer accounted for at equity, the share of profit/loss from equity-accounted investment amounted to EUR 0.3 million (31 December 2022: EUR -151.9 million due to the final valuation of the equity interest in S IMMO at fair value). Financial results totalled EUR -246.1 million in 2023 (2022: EUR -72.6 million).\n\n#### Net profit\n\nProfit before tax amounted to EUR -313.1 million (2022: EUR 185.7 million), and income taxes equalled EUR 83.7 million (2022: EUR -43.7 million). Included here is deferred tax income of EUR 140.9 million, which resulted primarily from the write-downs recognised to investment property during the reporting period. Net profit for the 2023 financial year totalled EUR -229.5 million (2022: EUR 142.0 million) and represents earnings per share<sup>\\*</sup> of EUR -1.31 (2022: EUR 1.04).\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Balance sheet\n\nThe condensed balance sheet is shown below:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR          | 31 12 2023 | in %  | 31 12 2022 | in %  |\n|------------------------------|------------|-------|------------|-------|\n| Investment property          | 7,830,746  |       | 7,707,196  |       |\n| Property under construction  | 142,960    |       | 198,500    |       |\n| Owner-operated properties    | 229,634    | 87.7  | 231,827    | 87.9  |\n| Real estate inventories      | 4,841      |       | 4,963      |       |\n| Assets held for sale1        | 258,577    |       | 548,484    |       |\n| Other assets                 | 219,207    | 2.3   | 301,867    | 3.1   |\n| Equity-accounted investments | 33,151     | 0.3   | 36,284     | 0.4   |\n| Trade and other receivables  | 233,682    | 2.4   | 208,491    | 2.1   |\n| Cash and cash equivalents    | 697,119    | 7.2   | 652,750    | 6.6   |\n| Assets                       | 9,649,917  | 100.0 | 9,890,362  | 100.0 |\n| Equity                       | 4,563,084  | 47.3  | 4,741,552  | 47.9  |\n| Financial liabilities        | 4,283,531  | 44.4  | 4,167,470  | 42.1  |\n| Trade and other payables     | 289,951    | 3.0   | 256,613    | 2.6   |\n| Other liabilities            | 117,744    | 1.2   | 177,064    | 1.8   |\n| Deferred tax liabilities     | 395,607    | 4.1   | 547,663    | 5.5   |\n| Equity and liabilities       | 9,649,917  | 100.0 | 9,890,362  | 100.0 |\n\n1 Includes investment property as well as other assets that will be transferred to the buyer in the event of a sale.\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group's balance sheet totalled EUR 9.6 billion as of 31 December 2023. Of this total, EUR 8.5 billion, or 87.7%, are attributable to the property portfolio. The decline since year-end 2022 resulted mainly from market-related write-downs and from property sales in line with the strategy. Cash and cash equivalents increased to EUR 697.1 million.\n\nThe owner-operated properties with a carrying amount of EUR 229.6 million (31 December 2022: EUR 231.8 million) represent hotels held by S IMMO. These hotels are owner-operated, for the most part on the basis of management contracts.\n\nWith an equity ratio of 47.3% (31 December 2022: 47.9%) and cash and cash equivalents of EUR 697.1 million, IMMOFINANZ Group has a very solid balance sheet structure.\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-40-0\"></span>EPRA Financial Indicators\n\nIMMOFINANZ is a member of the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA), the interest group for listed real estate companies which is headquartered in Brussels. EPRA's mission is to promote, develop and represent the European public real estate sector. Its objectives are achieved through the provision of better information to investors and stakeholders, active involvement in the public and political debate, improvement of the general operating environment, promotion of best practices, and the cohesion and strengthening of the real estate industry.\n\nWith its Best Practices Recommendations, the EPRA has created a standardised framework for improving the comparability between real estate companies – above and beyond IFRS. IMMOFINANZ Group publishes detailed information on the EPRA indicators based on these recommendations (also see www.epra.com) as part of its commitment to full transparency. The non-financial statement (see Group management report, voluntary consolidated non-financial statement) also provides further non-financial indicators on IMMOFINANZ's performance, including environmental and employee-related issues, in line with the principles and criteria defined in the \"EPRA Sustainability Best Practices Recommendations Guidelines\".\n\n## EPRA net asset value for IMMOFINANZ Group\n\nIn accordance with the EPRA recommendations, IMMOFINANZ Group has published an expanded version of the net asset value indicators (NAV indicators) since the financial statements for 2020. IFRS equity forms the starting point and is adjusted to provide stakeholders with the most transparent information on the market value of the real estate company's assets and liabilities under various scenarios. The EPRA's net tangible assets (NTA) is the most relevant indicator for IMMOFINANZ Group's business activities and, consequently, serves as the primary indicator for net assets. An exact definition of the indicators can be found on the EPRA website (www.epra.com).\n\n|                                                                                                                                                           |  |  | 31 12 2023                    | 31 12 2022                |                          |                               |                           |                          |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|--|-------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|\n| All amounts in TEUR                                                                                                                                       |  |  | Net reinstatement value (NRV) | Net tangible assets (NTA) | Net disposal value (NDV) | Net reinstatement value (NRV) | Net tangible assets (NTA) | Net disposal value (NDV) |\n| IFRS equity excluding non-controlling interests                                                                                                           |  |  | 3,669,797                     | 3,669,797                 | 3,669,797                | 3,790,223                     | 3,790,223                 | 3,790,223                |\n| Diluted equity excluding non-controlling interests after an adjustment for convertible bonds and the exercise of options as well as undisclosed reserves1 |  |  | 3,669,797                     | 3,669,797                 | 3,669,797                | 3,790,223                     | 3,790,223                 | 3,790,223                |\n| Fair value of derivative financial instruments                                                                                                            |  |  | -123,064                      | -123,064                  | -

The write-downs to investment property also led to a reduction in deferred taxes. \n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe IFRS book value per share declined by -3.2% to EUR 26.60 (31 December 2022: EUR 27.47).<sup>\\*</sup> \n\n### EPRA earnings per share for IMMOFINANZ Group\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                                                                          | 2023     | 2022     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Weighted average number of shares in 1,000                                                                   | 137,974  | 136,867  |\n| Net profit or loss from continuing operations excluding non-controlling interests                            | -180,316 | 142,601  |\n| Revaluation of investment properties, properties under construction and other effects                        | 372,825  | 121,052  |\n| Results of property sales                                                                                    | 38,328   | -4,624   |\n| Goodwill impairment, negative differences and earn-out effects on purchase price adjustments                 | 174      | -214,323 |\n| Changes in fair value of financial instruments                                                               | 120,880  | -149,933 |\n| Taxes in respect of EPRA adjustments                                                                         | -104,480 | 8,804    |\n| EPRA adjustments in respect of joint ventures and non-controlling interests                                  | -44,961  | -13,268  |\n| EPRA earnings                                                                                                | 202,450  | -109,690 |\n| EPRA earnings per share in EUR                                                                               | 1.47     | -0.80    |\n| Company-specific adjustments                                                                                 |          |          |\n| One-time effects in other operating expenses                                                                 |          | 11,173   |\n| Valuation S IMMO                                                                                             |          | 182,940  |\n| Foreign exchange gains and losses                                                                            | 8,847    | -2,332   |\n| Deferred taxes in respect of company-specific adjustments                                                    | -2,825   | -45,632  |\n| EPRA adjustments in respect of joint ventures and non-controlling interests for company-specific adjustments | -2,742   | 14       |\n| Company-specific adjusted EPRA earnings                                                                      | 205,730  | 36,472   |\n| EPRA earnings per share after company-specific adjustments in EUR                                            | 1.49     | 0.27     |\n\nEPRA earnings per share equalled EUR 1.47 in 2023, compared with EUR -0.80 in the previous year.

An integrated risk management process provides the Group with a sound basis for the timely identification of potential risks and the assessment of the possible consequences.\n\nRisks represent the possibility of deviating from planned targets as the result of \"coincidental\" disruptions caused by the unpredictable nature of the future. In this connection, negative variances are considered risks in the strict sense of the term and positive variances are seen as opportunities.\n\n### Principles of integrated risk management\n\nThe structure of IMMOFINANZ's risk management is based on the rules of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code and the integrated framework of the COSO ERM<sup>\\*</sup>, an internationally recognised concept for the design of risk management systems.\n\nBased on the hedging and management instruments currently in use, no material risks can be identified at the present time that would endanger the company's standing as a going concern. The overall risk situation for the company and for the entire market in 2023 was influenced by the challenging political and macroeconomic environment. The major risk categories are discussed in greater detail at the end of this risk report.\n\nThe procedures for handling risk are anchored in a Group-wide risk management system which is integrated in operating practices and reporting paths and has a direct influence on processes and strategic decisions. Risk management takes place at all levels through internal guidelines, reporting systems and the internal control system (ICS) which is monitored by the internal audit department.\n\n#### Monitoring and control of the risk management system\n\nThe risk management system is monitored and controlled through two corporate channels. On the one hand, internal audit evaluates the effectiveness of risk management and contributes to its improvement. On the other hand, the auditor reviews the functionality of risk management in accordance with C-Rule 83 of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code (in the version released in January 2023) and reports to the Executive Board on the results of this analysis.\n\n#### Evaluation of the functionality of the risk management system\n\nErnst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H., Vienna, evaluated the effectiveness of IMMOFINANZ's risk management system during the period from December 2023 to February 2024. This analysis covered the design and implementation of the measures and organisational procedures instituted by the company, but not their application in the sense of operating effectiveness. The conclusions by Ernst & Young indicated that the risk management system instituted by IMMOFINANZ as of 31 December 2023 – based on the COSO comprehensive framework for corporate risk management – is functional.\n\n### Structure of risk management\n\nThe goal of risk management at IMMOFINANZ is to implement the strategy defined by the Executive Board with a minimum of risk. The Group's strategic goals are transferred to the operating processes where the measures for the identification, prevention and management of risks are located.\n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Responsibilities and reporting paths\n\n| Supervisory Board                   |                 |           |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------|\n| Executive Board                     |                 |           |\n| Department heads/Country management | Risk management |           |\n| Employees                           | Employees       | Employees |\n\nThe Executive Board is responsible for risk management in the IMMOFINANZ and defines the corporate goals and related risk strategy.\n\nRisk management is a staff function which reports directly to the Executive Board. It monitors the corporate risks that are not related to specific business areas, aggregates risk data and reports, and actively supports the business areas and country organisations in the identification of risks and economically feasible countermeasures. Risk management reports regularly to the Executive Board and quarterly to the Supervisory Board.\n\nAt the country organisation level, the heads of the respective units are responsible for risk management. Risk positions are reported to the Executive Board at least once each quarter by the business area and country managers. Acute risks are reported immediately to the Executive Board.\n\n#### Risk management process\n\nImage /page/46/Figure/7 description: The image shows a flowchart of risk management steps. The first step is \"Risk identification\", which includes basis for risk management and further analyses, selection of segments/business areas to be monitored, and assignment of risks to the relevant level of influence in the organization. The second step is \"Risk assessment\", which includes evaluation of individual risks and their intercorrelation, and classification of risks to create a basis for their management. The third step is \"Risk management\", which includes definition of measures to manage risk, and allocation of risk impact on P&L positions and indicators. The fourth step is \"Risk controlling\", which includes modeling of risks and their impact on results, and regular monitoring of risks, including adjustment of the underlying assumptions.\n\n#### Material risk categories\n\nThe risk categories relevant for IMMOFINANZ follow the company's value chain and are also focused on environmental, governance and social opportunities and risks. IMMOFINANZ has defined a broad range of measures to address and counter risks. These measures represent an integral part of all corporate processes and, consequently, form the basis for the reduction of risk.\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Risk category                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Countermeasures                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Business risks                       | These risks are related to the general framework condi-<br>tions for business activities and exceed the scope of<br>property-specific risks.                                                                                                              | These risks are countered by strategic decisions at the<br>corporate level.                                                                                                                                                      |\n|                                      | Financial risks are related to lenders or the terms and<br>conditions for the provision of cash and cash equivalents<br>(see section 7.2 in the consolidated financial state-<br>ments).                                                                  | The continuous monitoring of asset and liability posi-<br>tions as well as proactive analyses form the basis for<br>strategic measures to safeguard the company's finan-<br>cial strength.                                       |\n|                                      | Operational risk can arise through detrimental actions by<br>corporate bodies and/or employees to the disadvantage<br>of the company.                                                                                                                     | The company's activities are separated into individual<br>processes and relevant process steps are controlled in-<br>ternally.                                                                                                   |\n|                                      | Other risks represent individual risks with a Group-wide<br>impact.                                                                                                                                                                                       | These risks are countered by strategic decisions at the<br>corporate level.                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Risks of improper business practices | IMMOFINANZ is committed to responsible and transpar-<br>ent actions and to compliance with legal rules and regu-<br>lations.

We help potential tenants to explore their individual needs in terms of space and facilities. Existing tenants are supported on a day-to-day basis by property and facility managers in all property-specific matters. We are also continuously working to further increase customer satisfaction and user experience through digitalisation measures.\n\nIn addition to individual discussions with tenants, regular tenant surveys have been conducted for several years to evaluate customer satisfaction in the office sector. Site-specific optimisation measures, such as those based on a survey on the gastronomic offerings at the myhive Wienerberg location, are derived from the results. Suggestions and requests from various tenant surveys have also been incorporated into the design of new product offerings, such as the increased flexibility at myhive. In addition, community managers act as a central interface for the wishes and suggestions of tenants and their employees.\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the retail area, tenant satisfaction is also regularly analysed using different types of survey methods. On the one hand, regular meetings with our tenants take place in order to evaluate past and future cooperation. On the other hand, we also conduct structured tenant surveys in the retail area as needed. In addition, our center management teams in the shopping centers serve as points of contact for all tenant concerns. Moreover, a marketing and event plan is developed annually in collaboration with the tenants to ensure that activities and initiatives in which tenants can participate take place on a regular basis. If an office property is located next to a retail property, the office employees will receive special discounts for shopping and the food court.\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group is responsible for compliance with construction and safety regulations to protect building users and the neighbourhood. We therefore aim to ensure a safe environment for tenants and other users of our property portfolio, to prevent potential safety hazards and, if the need arises, to identify and eliminate them in good time – all in accordance with the applicable legislative framework as well as relevant standards and policies. This applies, for example, to all safety-specific aspects relating to fire protection, safety and well-being of people and the environment, and organisational safety measures. Our properties are constructed and operated in accordance with the applicable legal provisions and adapted where necessary to new legal requirements.\n\n#### Socially sustainable spaces\n\n#### Management approach Impacts, risks and opportunities Climate change Soil sealing Lack of social interaction reduces sense of belonging and participation Neglect of social activities can lead to reduced performance Policies and obligations Green lease strategy Objectives and targets Group-wide standardised green lease contracts for all new commercial leases and extensions Development of criteria for sustainable and healthy spaces by 2024 Increase in the share of certified buildings Building a tenant community Measures taken Rollout and green lease pilot project in 2023 Achievement of top building certifications and recertifications Relevant key indicators GRI 203-1 Infrastructure investments and services supported\n\nAn important element of IMMOFINANZ Group's ESG strategy is the introduction and implementation of the green lease strategy in our portfolio. As part of this process a Group-wide standardised model green lease contract has been developed and rolled out to the entire portfolio of IMMOFINANZ Group. In accordance with the green lease strategy, all tenants are called upon to apply this model contract. As of 31 December 2023, green lease contracts had already been signed in five different countries.\n\nThe myhive offices score points with a feel-good atmosphere in the common areas, numerous services and the best infrastructure. They offer space for communicative and lively interaction between tenants and their employees, for example in attractive communication zones and tenant lounges, and during regular events such as after-work events, business breakfasts with expert lectures or the organisation of sports activities.\n\nParticular importance is attached to networking among tenants. Dedicated community managers are the central point of contact for tenants and their employees. They take care of the exchange among tenants, identify opportunities for cooperation, arrange appropriate contacts and organise events. The cross-border myhive app provides information about all news in the respective office building and the myhive community, facilitates communication with experts from other companies at the location and supports central services provided by IMMOFINANZ, for example through a direct feedback tool. This makes it possible to communicate registrations for events, suggestions and requests or damage reports quickly and easily.\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe use of social media has also been continuously expanded. Currently, almost 4,200 users use the myhive app and the number of followers on social media (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn) totals more than 860,000.\n\n#### Socially sustainable workplaces & employee satisfaction\n\nImage /page/78/Picture/3 description: The image shows three Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) icons. The first icon, on a green background, represents SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being. It features a white line graph resembling a heartbeat, with a white heart at the end. The second icon, on a red background, represents SDG 5: Gender Equality. It features a white gender symbol with an equal sign in the middle. The third icon, on a maroon background, represents SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. It features a white bar graph with an upward-pointing arrow.\n\nWe are committed to creating an inclusive working environment in the Group, characterised by openness and mutual respect where every employee feels valued and heard. The focus is on our attractiveness as an employer and on employee retention. Derived from this, employee development and satisfaction, our social commitment as well as diversity, equal opportunities and inclusion are material topics in this focus area.\n\nAfter the majority takeover of IMMOFINANZ by CPIPG, the work on optimising the structure in Austria continued throughout 2023.\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group had 237 employees in 2023, with 137 of them working for IMMOFINANZ and 100 for S IMMO (2022: IMMOFINANZ Group: 300, IMMOFINANZ: 170, S IMMO: 130). The decline in the number of employees is largely due to the takeover of the IMMOFINANZ country organisations by CPIPG. The package of measures of IMMOFINANZ agreed with the Works Council in 20022 to prevent, eliminate and mitigate the implications of the restructuring was extended for 2023. This package includes, in particular, voluntary severance payments and one-off payments and is designed to mitigate potential negative economic consequences for employees. It was applied to individual employees in Austria.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, two persons worked for S IMMO who are not employees.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Employee development\n\n| Management approach              |                                                                                                                 |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Impacts, risks and opportunities | Supporting employees in their current and future roles                                                          |\n|                                  | Ensuring competitiveness                                                                                        |\n|                                  | High engagement and motivation of employees                                                                     |\n|                                  | Talent management                                                                                               |\n|                                  | Potential increase in costs for recruiting                                                                      |\n|                                  | Potential lack of innovative strength                                                                           |\n|                                  | Potential increase in turnover rate                                                                             |\n| Policies and obligations         | Performance management                                                                                          |\n|                                  | Performance review of employees                                                                                 |\n|                                  | Training and development programmes                                                                             |\n| Objectives and targets           | Empowering employees to be successful in their current and future roles based on career and succession planning |\n|                                  | At least eight hours of training per employee per year                                                          |\n| Measures taken                   | Apprenticeship programmes                                                                                       |\n|                                  | Individual coaching                                                                                             |\n| Relevant key indicators          | GRI 404-1 Average hours of training per year and employee                                                       |\n|                                  | GRI 404-2 Programmes for upgrading employee skills and transition assistance programmes                         |\n|                                  | GRI 404-3 Percentage of employees receiving regular performance and career development reviews                  |\n|                                  | GRI 401-1 New employee hires and employee turnover                                                              |\n|                                  | GRI 401-2 Benefits provided to full-time employees that are not provided to temporary or part-time employees    |\n|                                  | GRI 401-3 Parental leave                                                                                        |\n|                                  | EPRA Emp-Training, Emp-Dev                                                                                      |\n\nIMMOFINANZ strives to create a framework for its employees in which they can develop their potential, strengths and competencies to the best of their abilities. We lead our employees in a trusting manner and place great value on open and respectful interaction with each other. The People & Culture department is responsible for strategic personnel development and further development of the corporate culture in close cooperation with the Executive Board, which discusses current company developments with the Works Council at least once a month.\n\nIn connection with employee development, the focus of training is on expanding professional as well as personal and leadership skills. An important instrument in the context of performance management is the annual performance review between employees and their managers. This defines clear targets and individual training activities. As in previous financial years, performance reviews were conducted with 100% of employees of IMMOFINANZ in 2023. These interviews also include feedback from employees on several questions relating to personal well-being, further development and teamwork as well as suggestions for improvement.\n\n#### Employee development\n\nDeveloping strong leaders and appropriately trained and motivated employees is essential to overcome the complex and multifaceted challenges arising from the current multiple crises and to develop the necessary skills to address them effectively. IMMOFINANZ supports its employees by providing appropriate methods and tools. In coordination with their managers, employees can participate in individual training and coaching (especially for leaders). Finally, employees can also participate in conferences as part of this offering.\n\nLanguage courses as well as various types of individual and group training are offered on a regular basis and taken advantage of by employees.\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, around 3,221 hours of training were completed by the employees of IMMOFINANZ Group (thereof IMMOFINANZ 2,216, S IMMO 1,005, 2022: IMMOFINANZ 2,630, S IMMO not disclosed), equivalent to 13.6 hours per employee (IMMOFINANZ 16.2, S IMMO 10.1, 2022: IMMOFINANZ 16.2, S IMMO not disclosed) and thus significantly exceeding the Group-wide target of eight hours per employee. The largest share of training hours was accounted for by compliance training, followed by external training and language courses. The majority of the training courses were held in Austria.\n\n#### Diversity, equality and inclusion\n\n| Management approach              |                                                                                                                 |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Impacts, risks and opportunities | Cultural diversity                                                                                              |\n|                                  | Strengthening innovative power and ability to find solutions<br>based on diverse teams                          |\n|                                  | Increased productivity and motivation                                                                           |\n|                                  | Strengthening team spirit                                                                                       |\n|                                  | Promotion of equal opportunities                                                                                |\n|                                  | Prevention of social discrimination                                                                             |\n| Policies and obligations         | Code of Conduct                                                                                                 |\n| Objectives and targets           | Share of female managers at least 33%                                                                           |\n|                                  | Ensure gender and national diversity in the entire organisation at<br>Group and local level                     |\n| Measures taken                   | Analysis of gender pay ratios                                                                                   |\n| Relevant key indicators          | GRI 401-2 Benefits provided to full-time employees that are not<br>provided to temporary or part-time employees |\n|                                  | GRI 401-3 Parental leave                                                                                        |\n|                                  | GRI 405-1 Diversity of governance bodies and employees                                                          |\n|                                  | GRI 405-2 Ratio of basic salary and remuneration of women to<br>men                                             |\n|                                  | GRI 406-1 Incidents of discrimination and corrective actions taken                                              |\n|                                  | EPRA Diversity-Emp, Diversity-Pay                                                                               |\n\nAt IMMOFINANZ, we firmly believe that a diverse and inclusive work environment benefits not only our employees but also our company. By valuing and embracing the unique perspectives and backgrounds of our team members, which is established in our Code of Conduct, we foster a culture of engagement and open communication. We know that our employees are more likely to work innovatively and share their ideas when they feel valued and included. In this way, they contribute to the growth and success of our company. Therefore, diversity characteristics, especially with regard to age, gender, national or ethnic origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability and educational and professional background are very important to us as an employer.\n\nAt the end of December 2023, six persons with a non-temporary physical, mental or psychological impairment or an impairment of the sensory functions were employed at S IMMO.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, 16 different nationalities were represented among the employees of IMMOFINANZ. The average age was 38.2 years at IMMOFINANZ and 44.1 years at S IMMO (IMMOFINANZ and S IMMO 2022: 37.7 and 44.4, respectively). The share of women in management positions reporting directly to the Executive Board was 23% (2022: 40%). The decline is mainly due to the transfer of female managers to CPIPG. The share of women in all management positions at IMMOFINANZ Group was 33%. The target was therefore met. Women account for 67% (2022: 66%) of non-management positions at IMMOFINANZ. After the gender pay ratio was reported for the first time throughout the Group for the 2020 financial year, analyses and adaptations were made in the following years. As a result, the gender pay gap has already been significantly reduced for both managers and non-managers. The indicator represents the ratio of the total average remuneration of female employees (per category of employee). It is analysed regularly, and further equalisation is being worked on.\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the past years, a wrong figure was reported for the total gender pay gap due to a transfer error. In the following table the figure for 2022 has already been corrected.\n\n#### Gender pay ratio\n\n|                                  | 2023             |        | 2022              |        |\n|----------------------------------|------------------|--------|-------------------|--------|\n|                                  | IMMOFINANZ Group | S IMMO | IMMOFINANZ Group1 | S IMMO |\n| Total gender pay gap             | 1.39             | 1.42   | 1.57              | n. a.  |\n| Breakdown by employee category   |                  |        |                   |        |\n| thereof top management           | 1.38             | n. a.  | 1.05              | n. a.  |\n| thereof middle management        | 1.13             | 1.17   | 1.18              | n. a.  |\n| thereof entry-level management   | 1.16             | n. a.  | 1.13              | n. a.  |\n| thereof non-management level     | 1.16             | 1.23   | 1.32              | n. a.  |\n| Annual total remuneration ratio2 | 18.00            | 18.38  | n. a.             | n. a.  |\n\n1 2022 only includes the data for IMMOFINANZ.\n\n<sup>2</sup> Annual total remuneration of the highest-paid person of the company (Executive Board member) divided by the median annual total remuneration of the employees \n(without the highest-paid person).\n\nIn the event of questions or potential conflicts, the Group Compliance Officer serves as an independent and confidential point of contact.

This strengthens the well-being and health of our employees.\n\nAs a real estate manager and developer, IMMOFINANZ's business is largely office-based and therefore has a comparatively low risk of occupational accidents. Health management therefore focuses on preventive healthcare and the promotion of sports activities.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\nIMMOFINANZ employees are offered flexible and partially flexible working hours, as well as part-time working models. In addition, a remote working policy was adopted in 2022, which allows our employees to also work outside the office. This allows them to better balance full-time employment and personal needs, which increases satisfaction and performance as well as the attractiveness of IMMOFINANZ as an employer.\n\nIMMOFINANZ supports its employees with a variety of offerings outside of the workplace, with team building and promotion of work-life balance being at the forefront. These include, for example, a sixth week of vacation time after three years of service, sports options via the myclubs app and participation in the Vienna City Marathon.\n\nTo support our employees' healthcare needs, we offer a preventive healthcare scheme. In addition to measures meeting all legal requirements, responsibilities include carrying out vaccinations, medical check-ups, eye tests and providing advice on preventive healthcare. In the 2023 financial year, the absence rate due to sickness at IMMOFINANZ declined slightly to 3.4% (2022: 3.9% at IMMOFINANZ).\n\nAll employees of IMMOFINANZ Group are insured against loss of income due to illness, unemployment, occupational accidents as well as incapacity for work, parental leave and retirement in accordance with the respective local legal requirements.\n\nIn addition to health care, IMMOFINANZ offers other company benefits. No distinction is made between fulltime and part-time employees. For example, all employees can choose between an endowment and death insurance. The Executive Board is also entitled to disability and invalidity insurance as well as a retirement pension. Other company benefits, such as share participation, are not offered.\n\nAn employee survey on the topic of \"psychological stress at the workplace\" was conducted in cooperation with the Occupational Safety Center Linz in 2023. The survey was carried out online and anonymously. The results were analysed in the fourth quarter and presented to the Executive Board. It is planned to inform all employees about the results in the course of the second quarter of 2024; in addition, workshops will be held to work on improvements for those areas which scored below the industry average according to the analysis.\n\nHealth and safety inspections are conducted at IMMOFINANZ's own office locations at least once a year by the safety officer, the company physician, the Works Council and the head of People & Culture. Occupational safety risks are evaluated and compliance with statutory workplace and safety regulations is checked. Together with the head of the People & Culture department and the Executive Board, the inspection results are evaluated in a meeting and measures for improvement are decided. In addition to the annual meeting, IMMOFINANZ has specially trained employees who serve as safety officers and can address any issues as they arise. Employees are also trained in first aid and as evacuation/fire protection officers.\n\nAll employees of IMMOFINANZ Group are covered by the respective local occupational and safety regulations.\n\nCollective agreements apply to 67.1% of the employees of IMMOFINANZ Group. Within IMMOFINANZ, the share is 84.7% (2022: 88.8%), at S IMMO it is 39% (2022: 35.4%). 100% of the IMMOFINANZ Group employment contracts in Austria are governed by the collective agreement for salaried employees in property management companies resp. employees in industry. For employees not covered by the tariff, salary schemes customary within the country and industry apply so that all employees of IMMOFINANZ Group receive adequate remuneration.\n\nIMMOFINANZ has also entered into a number of agreements with the Works Council, which are based on social partnership and are designed to improve the position of employees.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition, our Code of Conduct includes a commitment to respect employees' rights to freedom of association. We strive for and maintain a long-term and constructive dialogue with employee representatives.\n\nIn 2023, the number of employees leaving the company was higher than in the previous year. The current employee turnover rate at IMMOFINANZ Group is 34.8%; viewed separately it is 37.4% (IMMOFINANZ) and 31.0% (S IMMO, 2022: 21.6% IMMOFINANZ and 14.0% S IMMO). This is mainly due to the Group-wide restructuring and a change in the calculation method. The calculation logic was adjusted in coordination with CPIPG and S IMMO.\n\nThe average employment with the company was 6.6 years and 8.0 years, respectively, in 2023 (IMMOFINANZ and S IMMO 2022: 5.7 and 7.1 years respectively).\n\n#### Community investment\n\n| Management approach              |                                                                                                      |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Impacts, risks and opportunities | Social commitment as corporate responsibility                                                        |\n|                                  | Promotion of charitable work                                                                         |\n|                                  | Part of corporate culture                                                                            |\n|                                  | Creating value for the company and its communities in the medium and long term                       |\n| Policies and obligations         | Development of a Community Investment Strategy and Guideline by 2023                                 |\n| Objectives and targets           | Definition of IMMOFINANZ's core themes for community investment                                      |\n| Measures taken                   | Projects and partnerships with non-profit organisations                                              |\n| Relevant key indicators          | GRI 413-1 Operations with local community engagement, impact assessments, and development programmes |\n\nAs part of its social commitment, IMMOFINANZ aims to provide support not only financially but also through the diverse resources and competencies of the company and its employees. In this way, sustainable benefits can be created for our different stakeholders. Through our social commitment, we would also like to encourage employee engagement, thus strengthening employee loyalty.\n\nEngagement with our communities, i.e. all those people who work and shop at our properties or live in the neighbourhood, plays an important role for IMMOFINANZ. We always aim to view our properties in the context of their surroundings and people living there. The integration of a property into its immediate surroundings and the quality of implementing this integration increase the value of the respective premises and thus of the individual property.\n\nIn addition to the physical and online events for our tenants described above, we regularly launch initiatives for our communities, including blood donation campaigns or clothing collections for people in need.\n\nEvery year, as part of a Christmas campaign, IMMOFINANZ supports charitable projects and associations both in Austria and in other countries in which we operate. This year's donations of EUR 20,000 each went to St. Anna Children's Hospital and the children's hospice \"Netz\" in Vienna. In addition, the myhive community participated in the Christmas campaign of Caritas. 40 letters with Christmas wishes from children and adults from Caritas houses were received and handed over in person at the respective locations by the team of the myhive Community & Operations Managements.\n\nWe are working on developing further key performance indicators related to our engagement with society and will integrate them into our reporting in accordance with our comprehensive ESG strategy in the future.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Sustainable supply chain\n\nImage /page/84/Picture/2 description: The image is a square icon with a gold background. The number \"12\" is in the upper left corner, and the words \"RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION\" are in the upper right corner. Below the text is a white infinity symbol with an arrow pointing to the left.\n\nManagement approach\n\n#### Impacts, risks and opportunities Ensuring compliance with social and environmental standards along the supply chain Longer-term, reliable and resilient business relationships with our suppliers Support of local suppliers in the operating markets Ensuring resilience of our supply chain Policies and obligations Group procurement directive Code of Conduct Supplier Code of Conduct Objectives and targets Every new and extended supply contract is subject to the Groupwide Supplier Code of Conduct Establishment of an audit programme for assessment, definition of preventive measures and monitoring by 2024 Measures taken Supplier Code of Conduct introduced in 2023 Relevant key indicators GRI 204-1 Proportion of spending on local suppliers GRI 308-1 New suppliers that were screened using environmental criteria GRI 308-2 Negative environmental impacts in the supply chain and actions taken GRI 408-1 Operations and suppliers at significant risk for incidents of child labour GRI 409-1 Operations and suppliers at significant risk for incidents of forced or compulsory labour GRI 414-1 New suppliers that were screened using social criteria GRI 414-2 Negative social impacts in the supply chain and actions taken\n\nBuilding a sustainable and transparent supply chain is one of the greatest challenges in sustainability management for many companies. Various crises have demonstrated the importance of resilient value chains. This is also reflected in current regulations on corporate due diligence, in particular the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains (LkSG) or the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD). In this context, IMMOFINANZ is also working continuously to establish sustainable supply chain management.\n\nThus suppliers commissioned by IMMOFINANZ during the reporting period are broadly diversified and range from construction companies and property management firms to consulting service providers, insurance companies and IT companies. In the 2023 financial year, IMMOFINANZ procured services and products from more than 3,000 suppliers (2022: 3,000) with a total order volume of more than EUR 210 million (2022: EUR 201.5 million). As an international company, IMMOFINANZ worked with suppliers from 26 countries in the 2023 financial year. In order to ensure that procurement practices are sustainable and to maintain longterm, partnership-based relationships with our suppliers, 91% (2022: 97%) of all providers come directly from the markets in which IMMOFINANZ operates. Supporting these local suppliers and contributing to value creation in our core operating markets are therefore central considerations.\n\nThe process of selecting business partners is based on the internal Group procurement directive, which defines the procedures and specifications for IMMOFINANZ's procurement activities. In line with the Code of Conduct, these guidelines call for the careful selection of suppliers. A key concern is to minimise supplier risks resulting from child, forced or compulsory labour as well as risks arising from inadequate social assessment of the supplier. To this end, work is currently underway on a risk mapping process that will be applied to IMMOFINANZ's suppliers. The Procurement department reviews every new supplier based on their external presence (e.g. website) for indications which might call the company's integrity and authenticity into question. In addition, Procurement conducts credit risk assessments for potential suppliers which are expected to be \n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\nmaterial. In the event of a negative rating, the suppliers will not be listed. In addition to the responsible selection of suppliers, continuous efforts are made to intensify the exchange of communication between IMMOFINANZ and its business partners.\n\nAs part of its ESG strategy, IMMOFINANZ developed a Group-wide standardised Supplier Code of Conduct during the reporting year. This code is a mandatory contract component for every new contract and for contract extensions. It can be viewed on our website at https://immofinanz.com/en/sustainability.\n\n## Basis for preparation\n\nAs a company of public interest, IMMOFINANZ voluntarily prepares a non-financial statement in accordance with § 267a of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB) and thus also discloses information pursuant to the EU Taxonomy.\n\n#### Reporting standards\n\nThis report has been drawn up in accordance with the GRI standards. For the first time, IMMOFINANZ received the EPRA Sustainability Best Practices Recommendations Gold Award for its non-financial reporting in the 2022 annual report. The key indicators reported are based on the Sustainability Best Practices Recommendations Guidelines (2017) issued by the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA). In addition, the tables in this report have been adapted to the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), which are applicable starting from 2024, in accordance with the current interpretation.\n\n#### Reporting period\n\nThe non-financial statement covers the period from 1 January to 31 December 2023. The indicators for 2022 are reported to allow comparability.\n\n#### Scope of companies and portfolio\n\nThis report covers IMMOFINANZ AG and all consolidated subsidiaries including S IMMO (see section 8 of the consolidated financial statements of the 2023 annual report). The portfolio of the company including S IMMO comprised 432 standing investment properties as of 31 December 2023.\n\nThe indicators published concentrate on the activities of IMMOFINANZ Group in Austria, Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Serbia, Croatia and Italy. The properties are included in the reporting in accordance with the financial control principle. The operational control principle was used for the greenhouse gas accounting.\n\n#### Coverage and segment analysis\n\nThis report refers to the portfolio of IMMOFINANZ Group. To enable a meaningful analysis, the portfolio has been presented as a whole and split into segments in line with the structure of our financial reporting. In the EPRA tables, the indicators are presented separately according to our two main portfolio sectors, \"office\" and \"retail\" as well as by segment. Further information can be found in the tables on EPRA Sustainability Performance Measures (Environment). Due to different calculation methods and reference values, the ESRS and EPRA figures may differ.\n\nThe coverage rate regarding the evironmental indicators amounts to 100%.\n\n#### Information on the company's own business premises\n\nThe consumption figures for the operation of IMMOFINANZ Group's own office spaces are no longer reported separately as their share is immaterial. The business premises are largely owned by IMMOFINANZ and usage is shared with tenants. Therefore, the consumption of IMMOFINANZ Group's business premises is included in the totals.\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Consumption data\n\nThe objective was to use real data for all types of energy consumption (gas, electricity, district heating) , as well as water consumption for the twelve-month period. To this end, automatically transmitted data (smart metering), read-out data and data from utility company invoices were used. Where no complete data was available, consumption was estimated using appropriate assumptions based on lettable space. Where no data was available for the full year 2023, data from 2022 was used. The consumption of buildings purchased or sold during the year was considered for the full months in which these buildings were part of the portfolio.\n\n#### Waste\n\nWaste data is disclosed in absolute figures again this year. These are based on the invoices of the respective waste disposal companies. Where data was not available for individual sites, it was complemented with comparable figures, calculated using country- and asset-specific real data, or estimated. Where no data was available for the full year 2023, data from 2022 was used.\n\n#### External audit\n\nThis report has not undergone an external audit.\n\n#### CO2 footprint\n\nThe CO2 footprint calculation is based on the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard. Emissions are stated in CO2 equivalent (CO2e) terms. The CO2e values for electricity and district heating are based on information by the energy suppliers and on publicly available sources, including the European data from the Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB) as well as the government conversion factors of the British Department for Energy Security. As in 2022, missing Scope 3 emissions were estimated based on real data and spaces. Where no data was available for the reporting period, data from the previous year was used. CO2 emissions are verified at Group level.\n\n#### Employee indicators\n\nAll indicators in the employee section are stated based on the headcount (HC) at all fully consolidated companies including S IMMO as of 31 December 2023 (excluding the Executive Board and inactive employees). If an indicator is calculated on a different basis, this is shown in a footnote. The data underlying the calculation of the indicators is produced by the IMMOFINANZ personnel management software and complemented with the data provided by S IMMO.\n\n#### Boundaries of reporting – landlord and tenant utility consumption\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group reports the water and energy consumption of the owner (IMMOFINANZ) (\"within the organisation\"). In cases where tenants obtained energy or water directly from the utility company and the data was not provided, this share was added based on comparative values specific to the building (\"outside of the organisation\").\n\n#### Normalisation\n\nFor the intensity indicators (energy intensity, water intensity, CO2 intensity) the reference total area of the buildings was used as the denominator. In addition to the total lettable area of properties that formed part of the portfolio throughout the year, the total lettable area of properties that were purchased or sold during the year were normalised on a monthly basis so that the area is equivalent to the number of months relevant for the report on a pro rata basis. The intensity calculated contains the consumption obtained as described above.\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT Voluntary Consolidated

number of total hours worked by people in its own\nworkforce and multiplied by 1,000,000. Thereby, these rates represent the number of respective cases per one million hours worked. A rate based on 1,000,000\nhours worked indicates the number of work-related injuries per 500 full-time people in the workforce over a 1-year timeframe.

As part of our active portfolio management, we sold properties with a combined value of approximately EUR 751 million (including S IMMO) in 2023. The related activities in 2024 will continue to concentrate on the sale of lower yielding properties that bring attractive sale prices as well as non-strategic properties. The proceeds will be reinvested, as in the past, in valuecreating acquisitions and/or development projects.\n\nIMMOFINANZ as part of the CPI Property Group, approved the Group-wide adjustment and standardisation of the ESG strategy in 2023, which covers ecological sustainability as well as social aspects and good corporate governance. Our goal is to make an extensive contribution to the sustainable development of the real estate branch by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the use of renewable energies, decreasing water consumption and improving the recycling rate. Our plans for 2024 include, among others, the further expansion of photovoltaic equipment at our properties. The green lease contracts introduced in 2023 have been implemented in all our core markets and will be offered to tenants as part of our rental activities.\n\n## Financing and the capital market\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group has a very solid capital and financing structure with an equity ratio of 47.3%, a net loanto-value (net LTV) ratio of 42.1%, and cash and cash equivalents of EUR 697.1 million at the end of December 2023. An unsecured, revolving corporate credit line of EUR 100.0 million is also available. Roughly 95% of our financial liabilities are hedged against rising interest rates, and our goal is to continue this conservative financial policy. Gearing, based on the net LTV, should therefore remain at a conservative level over the medium term.\n\nOur focus in the current market environment lies primarily on long-term bank financing. For new financing as well as refinancing at the property level, we benefit from long-term, cooperative relationships with banks in our core markets. After the successful refinancing of approximately EUR 1 billion of bank liabilities in 2023, we are currently meeting with our financing banks to discuss the premature extension of expiring financing at the current market conditions.\n\nMost experts anticipate a reduction in key eurozone interest rates by the European Central Bank (ECB) in 2024. These prospects have recently led to a more optimistic mood in the real estate sector. Transactions could therefore increase during the second half of 2024, due to a more attractive climate based on lower interest rates and stabilised yields.\n\n## Close cooperation with CPIPG and S IMMO\n\nWork on the integration of IMMOFINANZ and S IMMO started in 2022. Under the direction of the CPI Property Group (CPIPG), we bundled resources in asset and property management and in other service areas to optimise our organisational structures and significantly improve efficiency. These activities successfully continued with the signing of a framework agreement with S IMMO to evaluate further integration options. We have already realised synergies, including common service contracts and the standardisation of IT systems and processes. The CPI Property Group, as the core shareholder of IMMOFINANZ, is actively supporting this process with an aim towards the identification and realisation of further synergies. In spite of this progress, our tenants remain our first priority. We intend to continue offering optimal property solutions in the future to further strengthen our leading position in the branch.\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-138-0\"></span>This outlook reflects the Executive Board's assessments as of 27 March 2024 and includes statements and forecasts concerning the future development of IMMOFINANZ Group.

Statements\n\n## 1. General Principles\n\n## 1.1 Reporting company\n\nIMMOFINANZ AG is the parent company of IMMOFINANZ GROUP (incl. S IMMO), a listed real estate company in Austria. Its registered headquarters are located at Wienerbergstrasse 9, 1100 Vienna. The business activities of IMMOFINANZ Group comprise the development, acquisition, rental and commercial utilisation of properties as well as the operation of hotels. The IMMOFINANZ AG share is listed in the Prime Market segment of the Vienna Stock Exchange and in the Main Market segment of the Warsaw Stock Exchange.\n\nCPI Property Group (CPIPG), which is headquartered in Luxembourg, is the parent company that prepares consolidated financial statements for the largest circle of companies. These consolidated financial statements are published at the corporate headquarters.\n\nThe purchase of 17,305,012 S IMMO AG shares from CPIPG at the end of December 2022 gave IMMOFINANZ a majority investment of 50% plus one share in S IMMO. S IMMO was therefore included through full consolidation in the IMMOFINANZ consolidated financial statements for 2022. The consolidated income statement for the 2022 financial year did not include any components for the S IMMO Group for practicality reasons. The comparability with prior year data is therefore limited.\n\n## 1.2 Basis of reporting\n\nThese consolidated financial statements of IMMOFINANZ AG cover the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. They were prepared in accordance with § 245a (1) of the Austrian Commercial Code and in agreement with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in the euro, which is the functional currency of the parent company. All financial information reported in the euro is rounded to thousand euros, unless indicated otherwise. The use of automatic data processing equipment can lead to rounding differences in the addition of rounded amounts and percentage rates.\n\nUniform accounting policies are used to measure the assets and liabilities of all Group companies, whereby these items are basically measured individually. Disposal groups represent an exception to this practice and are reported under \"assets held for sale\" and \"liabilities held for sale\" (see section 4.10). In addition, impairment\n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\nlosses are calculated in part on the basis of cash-generating units if the recoverable amount of specific assets (goodwill) cannot be determined separately (see section 4.5.2).\n\nAssets and liabilities are generally measured at amortised cost. For financial assets and liabilities, this involves the application of the effective interest rate method. In contrast, different measurement methods are applied to the following material positions:\n\n- Investment property, property under construction and owner-operated properties are measured at fair value.\n- Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.\n- Provisions are measured at the present value of the expected settlement amount.\n- Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are measured at their nominal value based on the temporary differences as of the balance sheet date and the tax rate expected when the existing differences are realised.\n- Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell unless they are excluded from the valuation requirements defined in IFRS 5. This applies, in particular, to investment property that is measured based on the fair value model.\n\nFair value is not always available as an observable market price, but must often be determined on the basis of various valuation parameters. Depending on the availability of observable parameters and the importance of these parameters for the general assessment procedure, the fair values are classified in different levels on the fair value hierarchy:\n\n- Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) on active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n- Level 2: valuation parameters that do not reflect the quoted prices defined for Level 1, but which can be derived directly (as a price) or indirectly (from prices) for the asset or liability\n- Level 3: valuation parameters for assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data\n\n### 1.3 Judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\n#### 1.3.1 Judgments\n\nThe following notes provide information on judgements made in the application of accounting methods which have the greatest influence on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements:\n\n- Full consolidation (see section 2.2.2): assessment of the existence of control over subsidiaries in cases where control is not based solely on the ownership interest (de facto control) and assessment of the existence of joint control or significant influence when a majority holding does not convey control over an investment\n- Full consolidation (see section 2.2.2): assessment of whether the acquisition of property companies represents business combinations in the sense of IFRS 3 (characteristics of a business)\n- Equity accounting (see section 2.2.3): assessment of the existence of significant influence in contrast to the assumption of such influence at an ownership interest of 20% or more and evaluation of the existence of objective indications of impairment\n- Functional currency (see section 2.6.1): determination of the functional currency of a foreign operation, above all when this currency differs from the currency of the subsidiary's headquarters country\n- Rental income (see section 5.1.1): assessment of the term of rental agreements with regard to the use of extension options and assessment of whether the modification to a rental agreement substantively represents a new rental relationship\n\n#### 1.3.2 Assumptions and estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Executive Board to make assumptions and estimates related to the application of accounting methods and the amounts reported for assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results can vary from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed regularly, and any changes to these estimates are recognised prospectively. The following notes provide information on assumptions and estimation uncertainty which can lead to a significant risk that a material adjustment will be required during the next financial year.\n\n{148}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Valuation assumptions and existing uncertainty (see section 4.1.3): determination of the fair value of investment property, property under construction and owner-operated properties\n- Rights of use and lease liabilities (see sections 4.1.1 and 4.14): determination of the remaining term of a lease together with any extension or cancellation options\n- Goodwill (see section 4.5.2): determination of the recoverable amount within the scope of impairment tests\n- Equity-accounted investments (see section 4.6): determination of the recoverable amount within the scope of impairment tests for investments in associates and determination of the fair value of investments in associates within the framework of purchase price allocation in the case of a transitional consolidation\n- Contingent receivables (see section 7.3.1): contingent receivables may only be recognised when their realisation as income is highly probable\n- Deferred taxes (see section 4.9): assessment of the usability of deferred tax assets (above all from loss carryforwards)\n- Real estate inventories (see section 4.11): determination of the net realisable value of inventories\n- Provisions (see section 4.16): determination of the expected settlement amount and the related present value\n- Financial instruments (see section 7.1.3): determination of the fair value of primary and derivative financial instruments\n- Contingent liabilities and guarantees (see section 7.3.1): assessment of the expected claims from obligations not reported on the balance sheet\n\nThe current macroeconomic situation, with its rising interest rates and high inflation, has a potential impact on the above-mentioned balance sheet positions. This has been manifested, above all, through an increase in the financing costs for new borrowings and in the valuation of interest derivatives, which has significantly affected the financial result. A quantitative evaluation of future events and trends is not possible from the current point of view. These developments have been reflected in both costs and earnings – in particular, through an upward trend in operating costs and revenues from the charge-out of these costs and, subsequently, in an inflationdriven increase in rents and an improvement in the like-for-like performance of rents. Rising prices are also visible in the costs of construction. These developments are important for property valuation because the key valuation parameters are based on the prevailing market conditions on the respective closing date. This led to substantial write-downs in 2023, and also to a lesser extent in 2022, and to negative \"valuation results from standing investments\" (also see section 5.8). The future movements of discount and capitalisation rates are also impossible to predict in this area. IMMOFINANZ Group is not directly affected by the war in Ukraine because the Group holds no property and has no business relations in that country. The Group is, however, indirectly affected through the effects of the war in Ukraine on the overall economic situation. A quantitative estimate of these indirect effects on the Group is not possible at the present time.\n\n{149}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 1.4 First-time application of standards and interpretations\n\nThe following new or revised standards and interpretations were applied for the first time in 2023:\n\n| Standard                                 | Content                                                                                                   | Published by the IASB<br>(adopted by the EU) | Mandatory<br>application for<br>IMMOFINANZ | Effects on<br>IMMOFINANZ |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| New standards and interpretations        |                                                                                                           |                                              |                                            |                          |\n| IFRS 17                                  | Insurance contracts                                                                                       | 18 May 2017<br>(8 September 2022)            | on application                             | No                       |\n| Changes to standards and interpretations |                                                                                                           |                                              |                                            |                          |\n| IAS 1                                    | Disclosure of accounting and measurement<br>policies                                                      | 12 February 2021<br>(3 March 2022)           | 1 January 2023                             | No                       |\n| IAS 12                                   | Change to IAS 12 – Deferred tax related to<br>assets and liabilities arising from a single<br>transaction | 7 May 2021<br>(12 August 2022)               | 1 January 2023                             | No                       |\n| IAS 12                                   | Change to IAS 12 – International tax re<br>form – Pillar two model rules                                  | 23 May 2023<br>(8 November 2023)             | 1 January 2023                             | Yes                      |\n| IAS 8                                    | Definition of accounting policies and ac-<br>counting estimates                                           | 12 February 2021<br>(3 March 2022)           | 1 January 2023                             | No                       |\n\n#### IFRS 17 Insurance contracts\n\nIFRS 17 regulates the accounting treatment of insurance contracts and replaces the previously applicable transition standard, IFRS 4. The scope of application of this standard covers insurance contracts, reinsurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary net income participation.\n\nThese changes had no effect on the consolidated financial statements because IMMOFINANZ Group holds no insurance contracts which fall under these categories.\n\n#### IAS 1: Disclosure of accounting and measurement policies\n\nThe changes clarify the requirements of IAS 1 concerning the disclosure of accounting and measurement policies. They replace all sections previously entitled \"(significant) accounting policies\" by the term \"(material) accounting policy information\". Information on accounting policies is considered material when it, together with other financial statement information, can reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of IFRS financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements.\n\nIn addition, the changes clarify that accounting policy information concerning immaterial transactions, other events and conditions are considered to be immaterial and must not be disclosed. Accounting policy information can be material because of the nature of the related transactions, other events or conditions, even if the amounts are immaterial. However, not all accounting policy information relating to material transactions, other events or conditions is itself material.\n\nThe IASB has also prepared guidelines and examples to explain the application of the four-step process model that is included in IFRS Practice Statement 2.\n\nThese changes had no material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### IAS 12: Changes to IAS 12 – Deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction\n\nThese changes further limit the scope of application of the initial recognition exemption. Consequently, a company may not apply the exemption to transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.\n\nDepending on current tax law, equal taxable and deductible temporary differences can arise on the initial recognition of an asset and a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and does not affect either accounting or taxable profits. This could occur, for example, on the recognition of a lease liability and the corresponding right-of-use asset under the application of IFRS 16 (Leases) at the beginning of the lease.\n\nCompanies are now only required to recognise the related deferred tax assets and liabilities, whereby the recognition of a deferred tax asset is subject to the materiality criteria defined in IAS 12 (Income taxes).\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Group has not recorded any deferred taxes to date which resulted from transactions that led to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The changes result in deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities of EUR 11.6 million each and, consequently, there is no material net effect.\n\n#### IAS 12: Change to IAS 12 – International tax reform – Pillar two model rules\n\nThe changes introduce a mandatory temporary exception to the accounting rules for deferred taxes arising from the implementation of the Pillar two model rules. Accordingly, the recognition of deferred taxes based on the design of supplementary taxes within the framework of the Pillar two minimum tax regime is excluded from the scope of application of this standard. Additional disclosures in the notes are also required, but are dependent on the status of implementation of the minimum tax legislation in the respective national tax laws.\n\nThe relevant disclosures are provided in section 4.9.\n\n#### IAS 8: Definition of accounting policies and accounting estimates\n\nThis standard previously included only a definition of changes in accounting estimates but no definition of accounting estimates. The new definition involves accounting estimates for monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty.\n\nA change in an accounting estimate that is based on new information or new developments does not represent the correction of an error. The effects on an accounting estimate from a change in an input or measurement technique represent a change in an accounting estimate unless they result from the correction of errors from earlier periods.\n\nThe changes had no material effects on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n### 1.5 Standards and interpretations applicable in the future\n\n#### 1.5.1 Standards and interpretations adopted by the EU, but not yet applied\n\nThe following changes to standards and interpretations had been adopted by the EU as of the balance sheet date, but did not require mandatory application in the 2023 financial year and were not applied prematurely:\n\n| Standard                                 | Content                                                                                                                                                                  | Published by the IASB<br>(adopted by the EU)              | Mandatory<br>application for<br>IMMOFINANZ | Expected effects on<br>IMMOFINANZ |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Changes to standards and interpretations |                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                           |                                            |                                   |\n| IFRS 16                                  | Change to IFRS 16 – Lease liabilities in a<br>sale and leaseback transaction                                                                                             | 21 November 2023<br>(20 November 2023)                    | 1 January 2024                             | No                                |\n| IAS 1                                    | Change to IAS 1 – Classification of liabili-<br>ties as current and non-current and the de-<br>ferral of the application date; non-current<br>liabilities with covenants | 23 January 2020;<br>31 October 2022<br>(19 December 2023) | 1 January 2024                             | No                                |\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group is evaluating the applicable changes to these standards and will apply them as of the mandatory application date.

Detailed information is provided in section 2.3 and 2.4. All other subsidiaries with an investment of less than 100% (see section 8.) have no material noncontrolling interests.\n\nRestrictions defined by the articles of association, contracts or legal regulations as well as protective rights held by non-controlling interests can limit the ability of IMMOFINANZ to gain access to the Group's assets, to transfer these assets between Group companies or to utilise the coverage potential of these assets to meet liabilities. Information on the existing limitations is provided in sections 7.1.4 and 7.3.1.\n\n## 2.2 Consolidation methods\n\n#### 2.2.1 Basis of consolidation\n\nStandardised accounting and valuation principles as well as uniform options and judgements are applied by all companies included in the consolidated financial statements. Material interim profits – which arise, at most, from the intragroup transfer of investments in other companies, treasury shares, receivables or properties – are eliminated. The financial statements of all companies included through full consolidation and joint ventures accounted for at equity were prepared as of the same balance sheet date as the consolidated financial statements. For associates, the latest available financial statements form the basis for accounting. In cases where a different balance sheet date is used, any necessary adjustments are made when applying the equity method of accounting for material transactions or other events that occur between the associate's balance sheet date and IMMOFINANZ Group's balance sheet date.\n\n#### 2.2.2 Full consolidation\n\nA subsidiary is an entity that is controlled by a parent company. A subsidiary is included in the consolidated financial statements through full consolidation from the date on which IMMOFINANZ Group attains control over the subsidiary and up to the date on which control ends.\n\nA controlling influence based on voting rights is generally presumed to exist when the direct or indirect interest in an entity exceeds 50%. In individual cases (see section 8.), interests over 50% are contrasted by statutory \n\n{153}------------------------------------------------\n\nrights for a co-investor or the absence of a connection between IMMOFINANZ Group's control over the investee and the receipt of variable returns. A co-investor may be assumed to have such statutory rights, above all, when there are wide-ranging requirements for unanimity or the co-investor's agreement on decisions over material activities (e.g. the sale of investment property). Investments with a share of voting rights less than 50% are reviewed to determine whether control is established by other factors.\n\nThe acquisition of a subsidiary requires a decision as to whether the entity represents a business in the sense of IFRS 3. Assessing whether acquired property assets represent a business in the sense of IFRS 3 involves discretionary judgement and, frequently, a detailed analysis of the acquired processes and structures, above all with respect to asset and property management. A concentration test is also performed on acquisitions to determine whether the entire fair value of the acquired gross assets is concentrated primarily in a single identifiable asset or in a group of comparable assets. When a business is acquired, the transaction is accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method defined by IFRS 3. This also applies to an acquisition within the framework of a business combination achieved in stages. The related transaction costs are treated as an expense, and deferred taxes on temporary differences between the fair value of the acquired property assets and their respective tax bases are recognised in full. At IMMOFINANZ Group, goodwill (see section 4.5.2) regularly results as a technical figure because of the obligation to record deferred taxes on the difference between the fair value and the tax base of the acquired real estate assets. The acquisition method is not applied if the acquired entity does not represent a business. The acquisition of shell companies and pure landowning companies does not normally involve a business. In these cases, the acquired financial assets and assumed liabilities are measured at fair value. The total of the financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value is then deducted from the transaction price. The remaining transaction price is then allocated to the remaining identifiable assets and liabilities (primarily investment property) based on the respective fair values on the acquisition date. Deferred taxes are not recognised (initial recognition exemption), and goodwill does not arise.\n\n#### 2.2.3 Equity method\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group's interests in equity-accounted investments comprise shares in joint ventures and associates.\n\nIFRS 11 differentiates between joint ventures and joint operations. The joint arrangements in which IMMOFINANZ Group is involved generally represent joint ventures. A joint venture is a joint arrangement under which the co-investors exercise joint control over a company and (only) have rights to the company's net assets. There are no direct claims or obligations arising from the company's assets and liabilities.\n\nAssociates are companies over which IMMOFINANZ Group can exercise significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in an investee's financial and operating policy decisions without control or joint control. It is generally presumed (but can be refuted) when the direct or indirect interest in the investee equals or exceeds 20%. The possibilities for influence created by company law (e.g. through seats on a supervisory board) or other available opportunities can also lead to significant influence when an interest is less than 20%. With respect to shares in real estate funds, IMMOFINANZ Group does not have significant influence, even with an interest of 20% or more, because it is not represented in the fund's operating management or this influence is excluded by the fund's legal structure (see section 8.).\n\nIn accordance with the equity method of accounting, investments in associates or joint ventures are initially recognised at cost, including transaction costs, as of the acquisition date. Any surplus of the acquisition cost over the acquired share of identifiable assets and assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities at fair value is recognised as goodwill. Negative differences are recognised immediately to profit or loss. Goodwill represents part of the carrying amount of the investment and is not tested separately for impairment. After initial recognition, the carrying amount of the investment is increased or decreased by the proportional share of the investee's profit or loss and other comprehensive income attributable to IMMOFINANZ Group until significant influence or joint control ends. Any losses recorded by an associate or joint venture which exceed IM-MOFINANZ Group's investment in this entity are not recognised. Such losses are only recognised when the Group has a legal or actual obligation to cover the losses. The investments in companies accounted for at equity are assessed for indications of impairment as of every balance sheet date in accordance with IAS 28. If any such indications are identified, the investments are tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36.\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 2.3 Acquisition of subsidiaries\n\nIn addition to the general disclosures on accounting and valuation methods (see sections 1.2. and 1.3), IFRS 3 requires additional detailed information on business combinations. The purchase of shares in S IMMO AG during 2022 represented a business combination achieved in stages in the sense of IFRS 3. Due to the materiality of this transaction for an understanding of the consolidated financial statements, the relevant disclosures from the 2022 consolidated financial statements are repeated (see the following). There were no business combinations in the sense of IFRS 3 during 2023, but transactions were carried out with CPI Property Group and are described in the next section.\n\n#### Acquisition of subsidiaries from CPI Property Group in the 2023 financial year\n\nVarious transactions were concluded with CPI Property Group in 2023, which did not qualify as business combinations in the sense of IFRS 3 because there were no business operations as defined by this standard. The companies acquired through share deals represented companies with properties in the office and retail asset classes in the Czech Republic and Hungary. Of the investment property acquired, EUR 219.3 million is allocated to the Czech Republic segment and EUR 601.2 million to the S IMMO segment (see section 3.6).\n\nThe investment property was recognised at the acquisition costs resulting from the purchase transactions, including incidental acquisition costs. Standard market purchase price discounts for deferred taxes and other purchase price adjustments were recognised. An interest rate derivative carried at fair value in a higher level intermediate holding company was also recognised and subsequently led to a revaluation of EUR 117.7 million to the property in accordance with IAS 40.\n\nThe following table shows the acquired assets and assumed liabilities as well as the purchase price, which was paid in liquid funds, and the liabilities superseded in connection with the settlement of the acquisitions. These transactions are included on the consolidated cash flow statement under \"business combinations and other acquisitions, net of cash and cash equivalents\" at an amount of EUR -686.4 million.\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                              | 2023     |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Investment property                              | 820,455  |\n| Receivables and other assets                     | 24,550   |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                        | 5,060    |\n| Financial liabilities                            | -126,721 |\n| Trade and other payables                         | -34,705  |\n| Net assets acquired                              | 688,639  |\n| Purchase price paid in cash and cash equivalents | -264,481 |\n| Superseded liabilities                           | -424,157 |\n| Consideration                                    | -688,638 |\n| Less cash and cash equivalents                   | 5,060    |\n| Net outflow of cash and cash equivalents         | -683,578 |\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Acquisition of subsidiaries from CPI Property Group in the 2022 financial year\n\nIn the 2022 financial year, a fully let portfolio of 53 properties in the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary was acquired from the CPI Property Group. The purchase price amounted to EUR 322.2 million.\n\n#### Successive business combination in the 2022 financial year – S IMMO AG\n\nIMMOFINANZ held 19,499,437 shares up to 26 December 2022, which represented 26.49% of share capital and 27,65% of the voting rights in S IMMO. This holding represented a significant influence up to 27 December 2022 when 17,305,012 shares of S IMMO AG were purchased from CPI Property Group. The purchase of the shares previously held by CPI Property Group gave IMMOFINANZ a majority investment of 50% plus one share in the S IMMO Group. The purchase price for this share package totalled EUR 337.4 million, respectively EUR 19.50 per S IMMO share, and was deferred by CPI Property Group up to March 2028 at the latest. The deferred purchase price was paid in 2023 and is included on the cash flow statement under \"business combinations and other acquisitions, net of cash and cash equivalents\".\n\nWithin the framework of the purchase price allocation, the total consideration for the business combination included the following:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                              | 2022    |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Fair value of shares held until 27 December 2022 | 344,945 |\n| Deferred purchase price                          | 337,448 |\n| Consideration                                    | 682,393 |\n\nSince the acquisition of S IMMO Group represented a business combination achieved in stages, the total consideration included the deferred purchase price component for the additional shares purchased as well as the fair value of the shares previously held.\n\nThe allocation of the total purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities (PPA) of S IMMO Group as of the initial consolidation date was based on the closing data reported by S IMMO Group as of 31 December 2022 and on identified necessary adjustments to the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n\nThe assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the business combination had the following fair values as of the initial consolidation date:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR             | 2022      |\n|---------------------------------|-----------|\n| Investment property             | 2,412,852 |\n| Property under construction     | 10,300    |\n| Owner-operated properties       | 231,827   |\n| Assets held for sale            | 539,084   |\n| Financial assets                | 83,560    |\n| Cash and cash equivalents       | 385,245   |\n| Fair value of other assets      | 99,810    |\n| Total assets                    | 3,762,678 |\n| Provisions                      | 1,111     |\n| Financial liabilities           | 1,374,383 |\n| Deferred tax liabilities        | 273,114   |\n| Liabilities held for sale       | 127,246   |\n| Fair value of other liabilities | 109,754   |\n| Total liabilities               | 1,885,608 |\n| Fair value net assets           | 1,877,070 |\n| Consideration                   | 682,393   |\n| Non-controlling interests       | 980,055   |\n| Badwill                         | -214,622  |\n\nThe resulting negative difference (badwill) of EUR -214.6 million was reported as part of the revaluation results from investment property and goodwill in 2022. This gain represented the difference between the net assets in S IMMO, valued in accordance with IFRS 3, as of the acquisition date on 27 December 2022 and the acquisition price for the controlling interest in S IMMO, which was derived from the market price plus a package \n\n{156}------------------------------------------------\n\npremium (also see section 4.6 for details on the valuation of the shares). The negative difference (badwill) resulted from a situation where the market price of S IMMO on the acquisition date was substantially lower than its equity valued in accordance with IFRS requirements. The recognition through profit or loss of this badwill was reported on the cash flow statement under other non-cash income and expenses, respectively reclassifications.\n\nNon-controlling interests were included on the basis of their share in the recognised assets and liabilities of S IMMO Group. No conditional consideration was agreed with the seller.\n\nThe standing investments were included in the consolidated financial statements of S IMMO Group in accordance with the fair value model defined in IAS 40 and, consequently, were already measured at fair value. The valuation of the standing investments was generally based on the discounted cash flow method applied by S IMMO Group (see section 4.1.1). Therefore, no adjustments were required to the fair value of the standing investments in connection with the initial consolidation.\n\nThe revaluation of the owner-operated properties, which primarily represent hotels operated by S IMMO Group, was based on fair value appraisals by the external experts at CBRE, Muhr & Wipfler and EHL. The revaluation in connection with the initial consolidation led to a gain of EUR 126.3 million.\n\nThe fair value of the bonds reported under financial liabilities was determined as the total future cash flows as of the acquisition date discounted with a DCF method. The future cash flows from the bonds were based on the agreed terms and underlying interest and repayment schedules. The interest rate curve used to discount the payment flows for the DCF calculation consisted of a risk-free basis curve and a premium for the risk of non-fulfilment (\"risk spread\"). The revaluation required in connection with the initial consolidation led to a reduction of EUR 41.3 million in financial liabilities.\n\nFurthermore, deferred taxes that were not recognised by S IMMO Group due to the initial recognition exemption were recognised as part of the business combination. The initial recognition exemption represents an exception under which a deferred tax liability or deferred tax asset is not recognised when it results from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability, when the underlying transaction is not a business combination, and when neither accounting nor profit before tax is influenced at the time of the transaction. The related adjustments totalled EUR 36.0 million.\n\nFor practical purposes, the consolidated income statement for 2022 did not include any components for S IMMO Group. If S IMMO Group had been fully consolidated as of 1 January 2022, the consolidated income statement for IMMOFINANZ Group would have been as follows:\n\n{157}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Scope of Consolidation\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                        | 2022     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Rental income                                              | 431,464  |\n| Operating costs charged to tenants                         | 152,988  |\n| Other revenues                                             | 3,401    |\n| Revenues                                                   | 587,853  |\n| Expenses from investment property                          | -81,668  |\n| Operating expenses                                         | -181,224 |\n| Results of asset management                                | 324,962  |\n| Result from hotel operations                               | 7,501    |\n| Results of property sales                                  | 4,623    |\n| Results of property development                            | -20,684  |\n| Other operating income                                     | 13,552   |\n| Other operating expenses                                   | -103,961 |\n| Results of operations                                      | 225,992  |\n| Revaluation results from standing investments and goodwill | 88,338   |\n| Operating profit (EBIT)                                    | 314,330  |\n| Financial results                                          | -18,543  |\n| Earnings before tax (EBT)                                  | 295,787  |\n| Income taxes                                               | -93,489  |\n| Net profit or loss                                         | 202,298  |\n\nSince IMMOFINANZ Group does not apply hedge accounting – in contrast to S IMMO Group – the amounts from the valuation of derivatives recognised by S IMMO Group directly in other comprehensive income are reported under financial results in the above table.\n\nThe gross amount of the acquired trade receivables totalled EUR 21.0 million. The net carrying amount, which represents fair value, equalled EUR 17.5 million. Of the acquired trade receivables, EUR 3.5 million were therefore expected to be uncollectible as of the acquisition date.\n\nTransaction costs of EUR 0.5 million related to the acquisition of S IMMO were recognised to profit and loss in 2022 and were reported under other operating expenses.\n\n{158}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 2.4 Subsidiaries with material non-controlling interests\n\nThe change in non-controlling interests is shown in the following table:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                               | 2023    |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Balance on 1 January 2023                         | 980,055 |\n| Net profit or loss for the period                 | -48,197 |\n| Other comprehensive income                        | 14,019  |\n| Transactions with non-controlling interest owners | -3,869  |\n| Distributions/Dividend                            | -19,048 |\n| Balance on 31 December 2023                       | 922,960 |\n\nIMMOFINANZ holds a direct investment of 50% plus one share in S IMMO Group and, consequently, there are material non-controlling interests in S IMMO Group. The subsidiaries belonging to S IMMO Group are listed separately in section 8. The cumulative total of the non-controlling interests attributable to S IMMO Group amounts to EUR 923.0 million, and the profit/loss attributable to these non-controlling interests equals EUR -48.2

For subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments that prepare their financial statements in a foreign currency, the determination of the functional currency is based on the primary (macro)economic environment in which the respective company operates. A determining factor is the currency in which the majority of cash flows, goods and services are denominated and settled in the relevant country.\n\nWhen the functional currency of a subsidiary cannot be clearly identified, IAS 21 allows management to use its judgement to determine the functional currency that most faithfully represents the economic effects of the underlying transactions and events. Management has principally designated the euro as the functional currency for the subsidiaries in Romania, Poland, Czech Republic and Hungary; however, the local currency remains the functional currency for individual purchased property, service and management companies. This decision reflects the fact that macroeconomic developments in these countries are influenced by the eurozone. In addition, the leases concluded by IMMOFINANZ Group in these countries and real estate financing are generally denominated in the euro.\n\n#### 2.6.2 Translation of financial statements from foreign subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates\n\nIn accordance with IAS 21, the modified current rate method is used to translate the financial statements of the Group's subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates whose functional currency is not the euro. The assets and liabilities in the financial statements to be consolidated are translated at the mean exchange rate on the balance sheet date, while the income statement positions are translated at the weighted average exchange rate for the financial year.\n\nForeign currency translation is based on the exchange rates issued by the European Central Bank and by the respective national banks.\n\nThe following table lists the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date and the average exchange rates for the key currencies from IMMOFINANZ Group's viewpoint:\n\n| Currency | Closing rate on<br>31 12 2023 | Closing rate on<br>31 12 2022 | Average rate<br>2023 | Average rate<br>2022 |\n|----------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| BGN      | 1.95580                       | 1.95580                       | 1.95580              | 1.95580              |\n| CZK      | 24.72500                      | 24.11500                      | 23.98231             | 24.56192             |\n| HRK      | 7.53450                       | 7.53450                       | 7.53450              | 7.53520              |\n| HUF      | 382.78000                     | 400.25000                     | 382.05000            | 391.16154            |\n| PLN      | 4.34800                       | 4.68990                       | 4.54079              | 4.68145              |\n| RON      | 4.97460                       | 4.94740                       | 4.95165              | 4.93465              |\n| RSD      | 117.17370                     | 117.32240                     | 117.25147            | 117.47581            |\n| TRY      | 32.65310                      | 19.96490                      | 25.77431             | 17.28560             |\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-162-0\"></span>3. Information on Operating Segments\n\n## 3.1 Internal reporting\n\nThe chief operating decision-maker of IMMOFINANZ Group is the Executive Board. Internal reporting to the Executive Board is based on the classification of data into eight regional core markets (Austria, Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Adriatic). Within the core markets, rental income is reported by asset class (office, retail and others) together with the income from the non-performance-related components of operating costs. Regions with a lower volume of business are aggregated under \"Other Countries\". S IMMO is reported as a separate operating segment The presentation of segment results is based on internal reporting to the Executive Board (management approach), whereby the statement of comprehensive income only includes IMMOFINANZ's continuing operations.\n\n## 3.2 Transition from operating segments to Group results\n\nThere are no material transactions between the segments which would affect profit or loss and, consequently, separate information is not provided on the elimination of intersegment amounts in the transition from revenues and profit or loss from the operating segments to the Group. Central services are allocated to the operating segments based on actual expenses. Service companies that only work for a particular segment are allocated to that segment. Transactions in real estate assets between the segments do not form a basis for decisions by the responsible chief operating decision-maker and, consequently, a transition is not provided for these transactions.\n\nInvestments in holding companies that cannot be assigned to a specific segment and non-operating subsidiaries are included in the transition column. This column also includes the elimination of immaterial intersegment transact.\n\n## 3.3 Information on reportable operating segments\n\nSegment assets consist primarily of investment properties, property under construction, goodwill, owner-operated properties, properties held for sale and real estate inventories. Segment investments include additions to investment property and property under construction as well as right-of-use assets as defined in IFRS 16. Liabilities are not allocated to the individual segments for internal reporting purposes.\n\nThe results of asset management and operating profit (EBIT) are used to assess performance and to allocate resources. The development of financial results and tax expense in the Group is managed centrally. Separate country boards, which report regularly to the chief operating decision-maker, were established for the core markets. EBIT in the \"total\" column reflects the same position on the consolidated income statement, which also shows the reconciliation to earnings before tax.\n\nThe accounting and valuation methods applied by the reportable segments comply with the accounting and valuation methods used to prepare IMMOFINANZ Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n{163}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 3.4 Regions as operating segments\n\nThe allocation of revenues and non-current assets to the individual regions is based on the location of the property.\n\n- Austria: The business segment Austria includes office buildings like the myhive location in the Ungargasse as well as the City Tower Vienna, which is classified as held for sale. The myhive am Wienerberg commercial and office center was sold to S IMMO in 2023 and is therefore reported under the S IMMO segment. This portfolio also includes individual retail properties under the STOP SHOP brand.\n- Germany: This portfolio includes the FLOAT office complex as well as the myhive Medienhafen Largo and Alto office properties.\n- Poland: Standing office investments represent a focal point for this segment. The major office locations include the Warsaw Spire, the myhive Park Postępu, the myhive IO-1 building and the myhive Nimbus Office in Warsaw. The Polish portfolio also includes VIVO! shopping centers in Lublin, Stalowa Wola, Piła and Krosno as well as STOP SHOP retail parks. Six properties were added in 2022 through the purchase of a retail portfolio from CPI Property Group\n- Czech Republic: The portfolio mix in the Czech Republic includes, among others, the Na Příkopě office property and the myhive Palmovka and myhive Pankrác House in Prague. Other important properties are the Olympia Pilsen Shopping Center which was acquired from CPI Property Group in 2023, the VIVO! Hostivař shopping center and retail parks under the STOP SHOP brand as well as retail properties which were acquired from CPI Property Group through package deals (2022: 30 properties, 2023: 22 properties).\n- Slovakia: The core business in Slovakia lies primarily in the retail asset class with the VIVO! Bratislava and the STOP SHOP retail parks as well as the 15 properties purchased from CPI Property Group in the fourth quarter of 2022. This portfolio also includes the myhive Vajnorská office property.\n- Hungary: Retail properties represent the focal point of this portfolio. In addition to STOP SHOP retail parks, this real estate portfolio was expanded by two additional retail properties through the purchase of a retail portfolio from CPI Property Group in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n- Romania: The business segment Romania covers retail properties such as the STOP SHOP Botosani retail park and the VIVO! Cluj-Napoca, VIVO! Constanta, VIVO! Baia Mare and VIVO! Pitești shopping centers. Also included are office properties like the myhive S-Park, myhive Metroffice and IRIDE Business Park as well as several properties in the Other asset class.\n- Adriatic: The property portfolio in the Adriatic region (Italy, Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia) includes STOP SHOP retail parks as well as various properties under construction and land. It also contains the Grand Centre Zagreb office building, which was sold in the first quarter of 2024, and one property in Croatia which is assigned to the Other asset class.\n- Other countries: Following the sale of land in Turkey (Other asset class) during 2023, there were no properties in this asset class as of 31 December 2023.\n- S IMMO: The increase in the investment in S IMMO AG to over 50% and the subsequent full consolidation of the shares led to the expansion of segment reporting at the end of 2022 to include the S IMMO sub-group. The S IMMO real estate portfolio includes office buildings, commercial properties, residential properties and hotels.\n\n## 3.5 Information on key customers\n\nIMMOFINANZ had no individual customers who accounted for 10% or more of revenues in the 2022 or 2023 financial year.\n\n{164}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 3.6 Segment reporting\n\nInformation on IMMOFINANZ Group's

Notes to the Consolidated Balance Sheet\n\n### 4.1 Investment property\n\nInvestment property includes land, buildings and/or parts of buildings that are held to generate rental income or for capital appreciation. The properties owned and operated by S IMMO Group (hotels) are reported under owner-operated properties. The space used by IMMOFINANZ is immaterial and is therefore included under investment property. Properties acquired at the start of the development process are classified as property under construction when the necessary decisions have been taken as of the acquisition date. In all other cases, real estate acquisitions are recognised as investment property.\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group filed applications for an immaterial amount of investment subsidies for investment property and property under construction (see section 0) in the Austrian companies during 2023. Investment subsidies are principally accounted for through a deduction to the acquisition cost when the asset is initially recognised (net method as per IAS 20.24).\n\n#### 4.1.1 Development of investment property\n\nDetails on the development of the fair value of investment property are presented in the following section. Foreign exchange differences resulting from the translation of foreign company assets at the rates in effect at the beginning and the end of the year are presented separately.\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                | 2023      | 2022      |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Beginning balance                                  | 7,707,196 | 4,736,375 |\n| Disposals following the sale of subsidiaries (2.5) | -75,646   | -95,379   |\n| Change in scope of consolidation                   | 821,079   | 2,412,852 |\n| Currency translation adjustments                   | -5,625    | 2,697     |\n| Additions                                          | 73,279    | 436,276   |\n| Disposals                                          | -187,999  | -39,427   |\n| Revaluation                                        | -353,154  | -97,573   |\n| Reclassifications                                  | 98,088    | 351,375   |\n| Reclassification from assets held for sale         | 9,400     | 0         |\n| Reclassification to assets held for sale           | -255,872  | 0         |\n| Ending balance                                     | 7,830,746 | 7,707,196 |\n\nThe development of investment property is as follows:\n\nDisposals following the sale of subsidiaries were related, above all, to land in Germany and Turkey as well as an office property in Croatia. The change in the scope of consolidation during 2023 resulted primarily from the purchase of office and retail properties in the Czech Republic and Hungary from CPI Property Group (see section 2.3). In 2022, this line included the properties held by S IMMO Group. The acquisitions principally represent investments in portfolio properties in the Czech Republic and Hungary by S IMMO. Also included here are purchases in Austria, Croatia and Romania, which cover acquisitions of EUR 51.4 million (2022: EUR 396.9 million) and subsequent investments of EUR 21.9 million (2022: EUR 39.3 million). The disposals of investment property in 2023 were related mainly to sales in Germany as well as the Bureau am Belvedere office building in Vienna. Reclassification to assets held for sale consisted, in particular, of properties in the Czech Republic and Germany, an office property and three retail properties in Austria, and two office properties in Bucharest (see section 4.10).\n\nThe reclassifications consisted mainly of transfers of investment property to property under construction (EUR -55.5 million; 2022: EUR -7.2 million) and from property under construction to investment property (EUR 139.4 million; 2022: EUR 356.9 million).\n\n{171}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### IFRS 16\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group leases real estate for rental to third parties (in particular building rights) and, to a lesser extent, leases buildings, land and other assets (autos and other items of business and operating equipment). The IFRS 16 rights of use resulting from the building rights are allocated to investment property. Information on the IFRS 16 rights of use related to owner-operated properties is provided in section 4.3, while information on the IFRS 16 rights of use included under other tangible assets can be found in section 4.4. For short-term leases (under 12 months) and low-value leases (under EUR 5,000), IMMOFINANZ Group applies the practical expedients defined by IFRS 16 and records the expenses for these contracts under other operating expenses (see section 5.6). The option to waive the separation of lease and non-lease components was not applied.\n\nThe rights of use for investment property and property under construction are subsequently measured at fair value in accordance with IAS 40 (see section 5.8 for the valuation effect) and represent the respective lease liabilities as of the measurement date (see section 4.14). Lease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost with the application of the effective interest method and include any foreign exchange increases or decreases (see section 5.10). Lease payments on the rights of use for building rights are normally indexed and, consequently, regularly represent the current market price. As a rule, the leases for building rights do not include any purchase options.\n\nThe rights of use included under investment property totalled EUR 55.3 million as of 31 December 2023 (2022: EUR 57.3 million). No rights of use were reclassified to assets held for sale in 2023 (see section 4.10). Information on the lessor's accounting treatment is provided in section 5.1.1.\n\n#### 4.1.2 Accounting policies\n\nThe fair value of the standing investments held by IMMOFINANZ as of 31 December 2023 and in the previous year was generally determined with the so-called hardcore and top-slice version of the investment method.\n\nUnder the hardcore and top-slice version, the net income generated by a property – up to the market rent (the so-called hardcore component) – is capitalised at a normal market interest rate as a perpetual yield over the entire term (term of the rental contract plus subsequent rental). The top-slice component (i.e. the net income that exceeds or falls below the market rent) is then discounted at a risk-adjusted market interest rate if necessary. The amount of the risk premium is dependent on the probability of vacancy.\n\nIn the S IMMO segment, the discounted cash flow method (DCF method) is used to value the standing investments in Germany and the Czech Republic. Quantitative information on the parameters used for valuation is provided in section 4.1.3.\n\nThe valuation of undeveloped land held by IMMOFINANZ Group is based on a comparable value method. This method uses the realised purchase prices from other sites with a similar location and size to determine the value of the target property.\n\nProperties under development and investment properties that were acquired for possible redesign and renovation (redevelopment) are measured with the residual value method in IMMOFINANZ Group. The appraiser is responsible for selecting the valuation method. Differences to the above-mentioned procedure are therefore possible.\n\nChanges in the fair value of investment properties, properties under construction, properties held for sale and properties sold are recognised to profit or loss and reported on the income statement under revaluation (see section 5.8). On property sales, the difference between the carrying amount on the last closing date and the last quarter prior to the sale is recorded under valuation results from standing investments, respectively property under construction; the difference between the carrying amount in the last quarter and the sale proceeds is reported under the results of property sales (see section 5.3).\n\nThe accounting for investment property in accordance with the fair value model requires regular revaluation. In IMMOFINANZ Group, effectively all properties are valued by independent appraisers in accordance with the recommendations of the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA).\n\n{172}------------------------------------------------\n\nCBRE served as the appraiser for most of the properties held by IMMOFINANZ Group as of 31 December 2023. Cushman & Wakefield (Slovakia) and iO Partners (Hungary) were responsible for additional appraisals. A very limited number of internal valuations were also carried out.\n\nThe valuations by these external appraisers are based on their market knowledge and the inspection of the properties as well as supplied information, e.g. rental lists, rental contracts, land register excerpts and maintenance and investment budgets. This data is reviewed by the appraisers, who verify its plausibility through comparisons with market data. The experts also make estimates, among others, for the occupancy, future rental income, scheduled investments and expected returns. This process is accompanied by the members of IM-MOFINANZ Group's asset management and controlling staffs. The results of the property valuation process are reviewed by internal experts in IMMOFINANZ Group for plausibility and coordinated with the Executive Board.\n\nAn IMMOFINANZ Group guideline and the contract concluded with the appraiser require the inspection of all properties as part of the initial valuation. Starting with the first follow-up valuation, the appraisers are required to inspect at least 10% of the properties in each country of their assigned portfolio and to examine all newly acquired properties each year. The on-site inspection of the property by the appraiser may not be older than three years.\n\nIn IMMOFINANZ Group, the properties are appraised for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements as of 31 December and, in part, also for the preparation of the consolidated interim financial statements as of 30 June. Internal valuations are carried out for the preparation of the interim financial statements as of 31 March and 30 September.\n\n#### 4.1.3 Valuation assumptions and existing valuation uncertainty\n\nIFRS 13 requires the classification of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in three fair value hierarchy levels based on the determining input factors. All investment properties are classified under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because of the various parameters used in property valuation that are not directly or indirectly observable on the market (see the following table for information on the most important non-observable input factors).\n\nThe classes are defined according to the respective characteristics, features and risks associated with the assets. The allocation criteria include the business segments and asset classes (office, retail and others). The office, retail and others asset classes are aggregated into country groups based on specific homogeneity criteria: West (Austria, Germany), CEE (Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania) and Other Countries (Italy, Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia).\n\nThis aggregation results in the following classes:\n\n- Office in each of the country groups West, CEE, Other Countries\n- Retail in each of the country groups West, CEE, Other Countries\n- Other in each of the country groups West, CEE, Other Countries\n\nThe following table shows the input factors used for valuation and lists the key input parameters for each class of standing investments. A minimum and maximum value is shown for each input parameter in the class; consequently, the various parameters are generally not related to the same property. In addition to the minimum and maximum amounts, a weighted average and median amount are provided for each input parameter within the individual classes.\n\nThe input parameters presented in the following tables for 2023 and 2022 are to be understood as follows:\n\n– Lettable space in sqm: the total gross space available for rental by tenants (excluding parking areas)\n\n- Market rent per sqm and month in EUR: the appraiser's estimate of the monthly rent for which a property could be rented by knowledgeable and willing parties under appropriate conditions and without compulsion in an arm's length transaction\n- Actual net rent per sqm and month in EUR: the monthly rent in square metres based on expected rents for the first year after the deduction of costs carried by the renter\n\n{173}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Capitalisation rate in %: yield based on the expected income from the property; the exit yield is reported for\n- properties held by the S IMMO Group which are valued according to the DCF method\n- Vacancy rate in %: the actual vacancy rate as of the balance sheet date.\n\nDepending on the estimates of risk – which are based, in general, on the asset class, the country and current market circumstances and, in particular, on the condition of the building, its location and occupancy rate – different interest rates are applied to the individual properties. The assumptions underlying the valuation, e.g. for market rents, rental default risks, vacancies or maintenance costs, are based on market assessments, on derived data or on the appraisers' experience. Comparable rental contracts and property transactions on the market are regularly monitored, filed and evaluated by the appraisers. These market benchmarks are then transferred to the target properties and estimates for future rents or a potential market price, in the event of a sale, are calculated.\n\nThe following tables also include the investment property classified held for sale (see section 4.10), in cases where current appraisals were available as of the balance sheet date.\n\n| Office<br>2023  |                  |

development as well as standing investments which were reclassified over time from standing investments to property under construction due to refurbishment or redevelopment. IMMOFINANZ views refurbishment and renovation as the structural-technical restoration or modernisation of one or more floors, the communal areas or an entire property to improve the overall standard. Above all, it involves preserving the value of the building substance and/or modernising the property to improve its potential. This involves the facade as well as the building core (floors, rental areas, communal areas, plant rooms etc.). Major renovation extends beyond normal maintenance and repairs and beyond a maintenance backlog. An important criterion for classification as renovation is the investment volume and a reduced occupancy level. A major renovation project is, as a rule, considered to exist when the investment volume equals or exceeds 10% of the property's current fair value and the occupancy rate has fallen below 50%.\n\nProperty under construction is reclassified to investment property when the development measures are finalised and the project is completed. This completion includes the transfer of general contractor activities, transfer to the asset management process and the approval of the Executive Board.\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of assets whose purchase or development requires a substantial period of time are generally capitalised as part of the acquisition or production cost. In accordance with IAS 23, the application of this accounting procedure is not mandatory if the acquired or developed assets are measured at fair value. Since IMMOFINANZ has elected to use the fair value model for the subsequent measurement of investment property (see section 1.2), borrowing costs are not capitalised on property accounted for according to IAS 40. The capitalisation of interest on construction financing according to IAS 23 was immaterial for S IMMO Group in 2023 and 2022.\n\nThe development of property under construction is shown in the following table:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                | 2023    | 2022     |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|\n| Beginning balance                                  | 198,500 | 474,311  |\n| Disposals following the sale of subsidiaries (2.5) | -1,025  | 0        |\n| Change in scope of consolidation                   | 0       | 10,300   |\n| Currency translation adjustments                   | 0       | -68      |\n| Additions                                          | 47,963  | 99,681   |\n| Disposals                                          | -2,100  | -30,343  |\n| Revaluation                                        | -20,792 | -9,180   |\n| Reclassifications                                  | -79,586 | -346,201 |\n| Ending balance                                     | 142,960 | 198,500  |\n\nThe change in the scope of consolidation in 2022 is attributable to properties under construction by S IMMO Group. The additions are related chiefly to development projects for the STOP SHOP brand in Croatia and Serbia as well as investments at myhive locations in Austria and Romania. The disposals in 2022 involved an office property in Austria. Revaluation results were influenced primarily by development projects for the myhive brand in Poland, Austria and Romania.\n\nThe reclassifications involve, above all, transfers of from investment property to property under construction (EUR -55.0 million; 2022: EUR -7.2 million) and transfers from property under construction to investment property (EUR 139.4 million; 2022: EUR 356.9 million).\n\nThe residual value method is generally used to value property under construction. Standing investments that were transferred to property under construction due to upcoming refurbishment or upgrading are valued as standing investments until detailed redevelopment plans are available. As soon as these plans are available, valuation is based on the residual value method. Residual value is understood to represent the amount remaining after the deduction of all project development costs and the imputed project development profit (developer profit) from the property's estimated market price after completion. The unrealised imputed project development profit declines with the progress on the project. The most important input factors for this valuation \n\n{184}------------------------------------------------\n\nmethod are the future rental income from the project, the discount rate (these two parameters generally determine the estimated fair value on completion) and the outstanding project development costs. The capitalisation rates for IMMOFINANZ Group's development projects range from 6.5% to 8.85% (2022: 4.3% to 8.25%), while the project development profit ranges from 5.0% to 17.5% (2022: 2.0% to 6.0%). The estimated fair values of the projects on completion range from EUR 9.3 million to EUR 108.9 million (2022: EUR 9.6 million to EUR 110.1 million), and the estimated outstanding construction costs by project from EUR 6.3 million to EUR 78.0 million (2022: EUR 3.9 million to EUR 78.3 million).\n\nInformation on other parameters relevant for valuation and on valuation uncertainty is provided in section 4.1.3.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, property under construction included rights of use totalling EUR 4.9 million (2022: EUR 0.0 million). No rights of use had been reclassified to assets held for sale as of that date (2022: EUR 0.0 million) (see section 4.10).\n\n### 4.3 Owner-operated properties\n\nOwner-operated properties represent hotels owned by S IMMO Group (first consolidated in 2022), which were recognised at fair value the consolidated financial statements. These hotels are operated by the owner, generally in the form of management contracts, which means the occupancy risk lies with IMMOFINANZ Group. These types of hotels are not covered by the scope of application of IAS 40 but are accounted for as property, plant and equipment in accordance with IAS 16. Owner-operated properties are measured in accordance with the revaluation model defined by IAS 16. They are carried at the respective revaluation amounts, which represent fair value on the revaluation date less subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated write-downs. If these owner-operated properties were valued at cost, depreciated cost would have equalled EUR 97.5 million as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 104.3 million).\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                          | 2023    | 2022    |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Fair value - beginning balance               | 230,600 | 0       |\n| Additions through business combinations      | 0       | 230,600 |\n| Additions                                    | 261     | 0       |\n| Disposals                                    | -99     | 0       |\n| Depreciation                                 | -13,441 | 0       |\n| Impairment/Reversals of impairment           | -1,825  | 0       |\n| Revaluation                                  | 13,005  | 0       |\n| Currency translation adjustments             | 0       | 0       |\n| Fair value - ending balance                  | 228,500 | 230,600 |\n| Accumulated depreciation - beginning balance | 0       | 0       |\n| Depreciation                                 | -13,441 | 0       |\n| Impairment/Reversals of impairment           | -1,825  | 0       |\n| Currency translation adjustments             | 0       | 0       |\n| Accumulated depreciation - ending balance    | -15,266 | 0       |\n\nThe discounted cash flow method (DCF method) was used to determine fair value.

Similar to investment properties, owner-operated properties are assigned to Level 3 on the fair value hierarchy (see section 4.1 for details on the valuation). The rentable space in the owner-operated properties held by IM-MOFINANZ Group ranges from 13,798 to 27,600 sqm (31 December 2022: 13,798 to 27,646 sqm), the net realisable rent per sqm and month from EUR 11.40 to EUR 24.70 (31 December 2022: EUR 5.03 to EUR 23.64), and the capitalisation rate from 7.65% to 9.80% (31 December 2022: 7.15% to 9.00%).\n\n{185}------------------------------------------------\n\nLeases as defined in IFRS 16 also cover buildings used by the owner. The resulting rights of use are reported under \"owner-operated properties\" and totalled EUR 1.1 million as of 31 December 2023 (2022: EUR 1.2 million). These rights of use are amortised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\n## 4.4 Other tangible assets\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, other tangible assets included IFRS 16 rights of use totalling EUR 0.5 million (2022: EUR 0.9 million).\n\n## 4.5 Intangible assets\n\n#### 4.5.1 Composition of intangible assets\n\nThe carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets is shown in the following table:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR     | 31 12 2023 | 31 12 2022 |\n|-------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Goodwill                | 19,312     | 19,530     |\n| Other intangible assets | 1,235      | 886        |\n| Total                   | 20,547     | 20,416     |\n\n{186}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.5.2 Goodwill\n\nThe development of goodwill is shown in the following table:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                          | 2023     | 2022     |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Acquisition cost - beginning balance         | 278,872  | 283,215  |\n| Disposals following the sale of subsidiaries | -63,239  | -4,337   |\n| Currency translation adjustments             | 0        | -6       |\n| Acquisition cost - ending balance            | 215,633  | 278,872  |\n| Accumulated depreciation - beginning balance | -259,342 | -259,283 |\n| Disposals following the sale of subsidiaries | 63,196   | 236      |\n| Currency translation adjustments             | -1       | 5        |\n| Impairment losses to continuing operations   | -174     | -300     |\n| Accumulated depreciation - ending balance    | -196,321 | -259,342 |\n| Carrying amount as of the balance sheet date | 19,312   | 19,530   |\n\nGoodwill regularly results as a technical figure when the acquisition of a subsidiary represents a business combination as defined in IFRS 3 and does not result in another acquisition (see section 2.2.2) because of the obligation to recognise deferred taxes on the difference between the fair value and the tax base of the acquired real estate assets. This goodwill is tested for indications of impairment each year. IMMOFINANZ determines the recoverable amount based on fair value less costs to sell and not according to the value in use, whereby it is normally assumed that net yields above the market level are not sustainable on real estate markets.\n\nThe cash-generating units generally represent individual properties or property portfolios. Due to the extensive number of properties held by IMMOFINANZ, the carrying amount of goodwill is aggregated by segments for presentation (see section 3.6).\n\nThe recoverable amount of the cash-generating units is based on the fair value of the included properties as determined by an expert opinion and includes the deferred taxes that are not transferrable to a hypothetical buyer as well as costs to sell. If the hypothetical transaction underlying the determination of the recoverable amount is assumed to be structured in a way that does not change the tax base of the assets – which is regularly the case with share deals –the deferred tax liabilities would be implicitly included in the recoverable amount at zero. Experience from recent transactions has shown that the determination of the selling price through negotiations generally leads to an equal allocation of the deferred tax liabilities between the seller and the buyer.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is then compared with the carrying amount of the included properties plus any goodwill and minus the deferred tax liabilities attributable to the respective properties. Deferred taxes are included in accordance with IAS 36 because these items are implicitly included in the determination of the recoverable amount.\n\nInformation on property valuation and the related estimation uncertainty is provided in sections 4.1.2 and 4.1.3. The selling costs for IMMOFINANZ are estimated at 0.5% to 2.0% of the respective property value and result primarily from brokerage services and legal advising.\n\nThe key valuation-relevant input parameters as of 31 December 2023 for properties that carry goodwill are summarised in the following table, classified by segments:\n\n{187}------------------------------------------------\n\n|

Together with the 19,499,437 shares previously held, this represents an investment of 50% plus one share in S IMMO and gives IMMOFINANZ a controlling influence over S IMMO. S IMMO was therefore reclassified from associates to fully consolidated subsidiaries as of that date. Due to the materiality of this transaction for an understanding of the consolidated financial statements, the relevant disclosures from the 2022 consolidated financial statements are repeated here.\n\nIn the transition consolidation, the previously held shares in S IMMO were considered part of the acquisition costs for the fully consolidated company and were measured at fair value. The absence of Level 1 fair values for the share package (unit of account), which represents a comparable capital interest, required a decision on the estimation method used to value the shares. IFRS do not provide any explicit rules for determining the fair value of such valuation objects in accordance with IFRS 13. The management of IMMOFINANZ Group decided to carry out these valuations as \"close to market\" as possible. The price on the Vienna Stock Exchange as of 31 December 2022, plus a package premium, therefore formed the basis for valuation. IFRS 13 permits the inclusion of premiums under the following conditions: when the premium reflects the economic characteristics \n\n{189}------------------------------------------------\n\nof the valuation object; when hypothetical buyers would include the premium in determining a purchase price; and when the inclusion of a premium does not contradict the unit of account (in this case, the equity-accounted investment in S IMMO).\n\nThe package premium was derived from comparable transactions (the purchase of capital investments in European companies from 2013 to 2022) based on capital market data. The premium for a share package with significant influence equalled 17.9% as of 31 December 2022. The fair value of the investment in S IMMO as of 31 December 2022 was based on a package premium derived from comparable transactions and increased to 41.8% to reflect the takeover situation. This was specifically based on the expiration of the extension period for the takeover process and on the fact that CPI Property Group failed to attain a majority holding of more than 90% of the shares and was therefore unable to execute a squeeze-out. Since the fair value was ultimately derived from observable and non-observable data, it is classified under Level 3 in accordance with IFRS 13.\n\nThe fair value of the share package was therefore based on the market price of EUR 12.48 per share plus a package premium of EUR 101.6 million (EUR 5.21 per share) and totalled EUR 344.9 million (EUR 17.69 per share). Since the carrying amount of the investment equalled EUR 537.2 million as of 31 December 2022, this led to the recognition of an impairment loss of EUR -192.2 million, which was recorded under equity-accounted investments and reported under the Austria segment.\n\nThe share of profit or loss from the equity-accounted investments also included the recycling of other comprehensive income from foreign exchange translation and the change in the hedge accounting reserve at a total of EUR 12.9 million.\n\nThe income statement for the 2022 financial year included the share of profit or loss from the equity valuation of S IMMO. This share of profit or loss included the proportional share of results for the period as well as the proportional share of results recognised in OCI based on the consolidated financial statements of S IMMO for 2022. Since the at-equity valuation of the S IMMO investment in 2021 was based in part on forecast data, the calculation also included the difference between the share of results recorded in the previous year based on this forecast data and the share of actual results that would have followed if actual data had been available in 2021.\n\nIAS 28.40 requires a company that applies the equity method, including the recognition of the associate's losses, to determine whether there are any objective indications of significant or lasting impairment to its net investment in the associate. Since the associates are not listed, the impairment test was based on qualitative criteria. An impairment loss of EUR -5.5 million was recognised to an investment in associates as of 31 December 2023 and is reported under other adjustments in the following table.\n\nThe following table provides aggregated financial information on the associates, including a reconciliation to the carrying amounts and shares of profit or loss reported in IMMOFINANZ Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n{190}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### IMMOFINANZ GROUP Annual Financial Report 2023\n\n|

Individual valuation adjustments are recognised for receivables that carry an increased risk of default. Consequently, all uncollectible receivables had been written off and all doubtful receivables had been adjusted through valuation adjustments as of the balance sheet date. These valuation adjustments are included in the results of asset management and are not reported on a separate line on the income statement, as required by IAS 1.82, because the related amounts are not considered material.\n\nValuation adjustments (resp. revaluations) to trade and other receivables are reported on the income statement under the write-off of receivables from asset management, which represent part of the expenses from investment property (see section 5.1.3), or under miscellaneous expenses as part of other operating expenses (see section 5.6).\n\nThe valuation adjustments to trade and other receivables totalled EUR -0.1 million in 2023 (2022: EUR -17.3 million). Detailed information on the change in impairment and default risk is provided in section 7.2.2.\n\n{193}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 4.8 Other financial assets\n\nOther non-current financial instruments include derivatives and miscellaneous securities as shown below:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR              | 31 12 2023 | 31 12 2022 |\n|----------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Other securities                 | 16,785     | 15,335     |\n| Derivative financial instruments | 147,585    | 235,983    |\n| Total                            | 164,371    | 251,318    |\n\nThe other securities consist of investments in companies. These investments include EUR 8.1 million (31 December 2022: EUR 7.6 million) carried at fair value through profit or loss and EUR 8.7 million (31 December 2022: EUR 7.3 million) at fair value through other comprehensive income. The convertible bond reported as of 31 December 2022 at an amount of EUR 0.4 million was carried at fair value through profit or loss and was converted in 2023.\n\nDerivatives are accounted for as stand-alone financial instruments and are used to reduce the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. Derivative transactions are only concluded with financial institutions that have first-rate credit standings. Derivatives are carried at fair value through profit or loss as of the balance sheet date.

These temporary differences are calculated by comparing the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements with the respective tax bases at the subsidiary level. Deferred taxes are recognised when the existing differences are expected to reverse in the future. With regard to the differences arising from the fair value measurement of investment property (see section 4.1), it is generally assumed that the temporary differences will reverse when the property is sold.\n\nDeferred taxes are not recognised for temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or a liability from a transaction which does not represent a business combination as defined in IFRS 3 and which does not influence pre-tax earnings or taxable income on the transaction date. This applies, above all, to the acquisition of property companies that are not classified as business combinations in the sense of IFRS 3 (see section 2.2.2).\n\n{194}------------------------------------------------\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are not recognised for temporary differences resulting from shares in subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates (outside-basis differences) in cases where their reversal can be controlled by IM-MOFINANZ Group and is not probable in the foreseeable future. For this reason, deferred tax liabilities were not recognised for temporary differences of EUR 1,980.9 million in 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 3,066.1 million).\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised on tax loss carryforwards when it is probable that sufficient taxable income will be available to utilise these tax loss carryforwards in the future. Deferred tax assets are also recorded in cases where sufficient deferred tax liabilities relating to the same tax subject and taxation authority were recognised and are assumed to reverse at the same time as the deferred tax assets on the unused loss carryforwards.\n\nThe recognition of deferred tax assets, in general, and deferred taxes on unused tax loss carryforwards and deductible temporary partial depreciation charges on investments (\"Siebentelabschreibung\"), in particular, is based on expectations by IMMOFINANZ Group's management concerning the availability of sufficient taxable profits in the future. These expectations reflect the previous history of tax losses, limits on the utilisation of tax losses, membership in a tax group and the possible expiration of tax loss carryforwards in some countries. Accounting decisions over the recognition or recoverability of deferred taxes are based, on the one hand, on the latest data from tax planning over a five-year forecast period and, on the other hand, on assumptions for the timing of the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and the availability of tax planning opportunities to utilise previously unused tax losses in Austria and other countries.\n\nThe recoverability of deferred tax assets by Group companies that recorded losses in 2023 or 2022 (EUR 6.6 million; 2022: EUR 2.6 million) is dependent on the generation of future taxable profits that are higher than the earnings effect from the reversal of the existing taxable temporary differences.\n\nThe following table shows the loss carryforwards for which deferred tax assets were not recognised. These tax loss carryforwards can generally be carried forward for an unlimited period unless designated as \"expiry\". Deferred tax assets were not recognised for deductible temporary partial depreciation charges on investments (\"Siebentelabschreibung\") of EUR 114.5 million (31 December 2022: EUR 114.8 million).\n\n| Country                        | Tax rate       | Loss carryfor<br>wards not recog<br>nised 31 12 2023 | thereof expiry<br>within 1–5 years | Loss carryfor<br>wards not recog<br>nised 31 12 2022 |\n|--------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Austria                        | 23.00%         | 1,735,081                                            | 0                                  | 2,146,903                                            |\n| Germany (corporate income tax) | 15.83%         | 362,938                                              | 0                                  | 345,278                                              |\n| Germany (trade tax)            | 14,35%–16,625% | 374,808                                              | 0                                  | 361,581                                              |\n| Poland                         | 9.00%–19.00%   | 14,789                                               | 10,248                             | 29,626                                               |\n| Romania                        | 16.00%         | 39,878                                               | 97                                 | 28,133                                               |\n| Slovakia                       | 21.00%         | 3,500                                                | 3,500                              | 2,905                                                |\n| Czech Republic                 | 21.00%         | 7,116                                                | 7,116                              | 0                                                    |\n| Hungary                        | 9.00%          | 35,900                                               | 20,966                             | 30,365                                               |\n| Croatia                        | 10.00%–18.00%  | 29                                                   | 29                                 | 1,196                                                |\n| Serbia                         | 15.00%         | 86                                                   | 86                                 | 34                                                   |\n| Bulgaria                       | 10.00%         | 19,843                                               | 19,843                             | 13,907                                               |\n| Netherlands                    | 19.00%–25.80%  | 1,610                                                | 1,610                              | 6,552                                                |\n| Total                          |                | 2,595,578                                            | 63,495                             | 2,966,480                                            |\n\nThe calculation of deferred taxes is based on the tax rate that is expected to apply when the temporary differences are presumed to reverse.

The guideline required implementation by the EU member states into national law by 31 December 2023 with enactment as of 1 January 2024. This directive was implemented into national law by most of the EU member states in 2023 with an effective date of 1 January 2024.\n\nThe takeover of IMMOFINANZ AG and S IMMO AG by CPI Property Group S.A. resulted in total revenues that exceeded the threshold of EUR 750 million. IMMOFINANZ AG and the IMMOFINANZ Group companies are therefore subject to the provisions of this EU Directive, respectively local minimum tax laws. CPI Property Group S.A. is the ultimate parent company of IMMOFINANZ AG and the IMMOFINANZ Group companies.\n\nHowever, IMMOFINANZ AG is classified as a parent company in part ownership because over 20% of its shares are held by parties outside the Group. IMMOFINANZ AG is therefore subject to the provisions of the Minimum Tax Reform Act on the low-taxed business units under its control and is required to pay a minimum tax in Austria.\n\nAll major countries (with the exception of Poland) where IMMOFINANZ Group is active have enacted national tax regulations for minimum taxation in accordance with the EU directive which took effect at the end of 2022. These countries have implemented the regulations through a national top-up tax that takes effect as of 1 January 2024. It is expected that top-up tax will be chargeable to the IMMOFINANZ Group companies in Hungary (9%), Cyprus (12.5%), Croatia (10%, resp. 18%), Poland (9%, resp. 19%) and Bulgaria (10%) because the applicable nominal tax rates in these countries are currently below 15%. It is also expected that, in the end, a national top-up tax will be introduced in all countries.\n\nIMMOFINANZ AG can require compensation from the other business units for the minimum tax it pays in line with the regulations defined by company law but no compensatory agreements have been concluded to date.\n\nThe quantitative effects from the application of the Minimum Tax Reform Act are currently under evaluation. Due to the complexity of the analyses and the fact that the necessary reporting processes must still be developed, the effects cannot be reliably estimated at the present time.\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group applied the temporary exception from the accounting requirements for deferred taxes in IAS 12 which was announced by the IASB in May 2023. Accordingly, deferred taxes arising from the application of the Minimum Tax Reform Act were not recognised in 2023. No current taxes from the minimum taxation regulations were recognised as of 31 December 2023 in the absence of application.\n\n{196}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 4.10 Assets and liabilities held for sale\n\nIFRS 5 requires non-current assets and groups of assets (disposal groups) to be classified as held for sale if they can be sold in their present condition and if appropriate documentation shows a highly probable intention by management to sell the assets within 12 months. A documented intention by IMMOFINANZ Group's management to sell an asset is, as a rule, reflected in a resolution by the Executive Board and also by the Supervisory Board if the transaction requires the approval of this corporate body.\n\nNon-current assets and groups of assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The following items, among others, are excluded from the IFRS 5 valuation requirements: investment properties that are measured at fair value, financial assets and deferred tax assets. These non-current assets must be presented separately according to IFRS 5. A separate provision is generally recorded when an impairment loss must be recognised to a disposal group because expected selling costs must be deducted from fair value and these adjustments cannot be allocated to assets covered by the valuation rules in IFRS 5.\n\nThe intention to sell investment properties or groups of assets that include such properties can (e.g. in the event of a change-of-control clause) result in the premature repayment of financial liabilities. Any expected decisions concerning premature repayment represent changes in the estimates for cash flows from financial liabilities and lead to an adjustment of the carrying amount through profit or loss. Financial liabilities attributable to a disposal group are reported under \"liabilities held for sale\"; in all other cases, they are reclassified to current financial liabilities.\n\n| All amounts in TEUR         | Carrying<br>amount as of<br>31 12 2023 | Carrying<br>amount as of 31<br>12 2022 |\n|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Investment property         | 255,872                                | 510,406                                |\n| Other tangible assets       | 2,705                                  | 18                                     |\n| Trade and other receivables | 0                                      | 93                                     |\n| Other financial assets      | 0                                      | 6,021                                  |\n| Cash and cash equivalents   | 0                                      | 31,946                                 |\n| Assets held for sale        | 258,577                                | 548,484                                |\n| Financial liabilities       | 14,786                                 | 77,839                                 |\n| Trade and other payables    | 856                                    | 892                                    |\n| Provisions                  | 0                                      | 552                                    |\n| Deferred tax liabilities    | 10,293                                 | 47,963                                 |\n| Liabilities held for sale   | 25,935                                 | 127,246                                |\n\nDetails on the assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are provided below:\n\nOf the assets and liabilities classified as held for sale as of 31 December 2022, all commercial and residential properties (EUR 501.0 million) were sold by S IMMO in 2023. Plans to sell an office building in Romania, which was classified as held for sale as of 31 December 2022, had changed and the building was therefore reclassified to investment property.\n\nThe following properties were classified as assets held for sale in 2023: two Czech companies each with a hotel property; three retail properties and one office building in Austria; two retail, three residential and two office properties in Germany; and one office building and two land sites in Romania.\n\nAll sales, respectively divestment resolutions by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board are intended to align the portfolio with IMMOFINANZ Group's strategic focus.\n\n{197}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 4.11 Real estate inventories\n\nThe properties held for sale by IMMOFINANZ Group during the course of ordinary business operations do not fall under the scope of application of IAS 40, but are treated as inventories in accordance with IAS 2. As a rule, these inventories represent residential properties.\n\nInventories of residential properties are valued according to the moving average price method. Disposals are calculated on the basis of square meters and, after the recognition of additions, measured at the average price applicable to the respective quarter. A provision is recognised for any outstanding construction work required after the transfer of a property, which increases the production costs of the sold inventories as well as the book value disposals. The net selling prices used for valuation as of the balance sheet date are normally based on current list prices less outstanding project development costs and flat-rate marketing costs; to a lesser extent, they are measured at the appraised fair value as of the balance sheet date for simplification purposes. Estimation uncertainty in the determination of the net selling price, e.g. concerning the outstanding project development costs, could lead to negative margins on the sale of the inventories (in spite of previous loss-free measurement) if construction cost overruns occur at a later date.\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                            | 31 12 2023 | 31 12 2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Inventories carried at net realisable value less costs to sell | 4,485      | 4,663      |\n| Inventories carried at acquisition or production cost          | 356        | 300        |\n| Total                                                          | 4,841      | 4,963      |\n\nWrite-downs of EUR 0.2 million were recognised to real estate inventories in 2023 (2022: EUR 2.0 million).\n\n## 4.12 Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, funds in transit and deposits with financial institutions with a term up to three months and, to a lesser extent, with a longer term that includes a one-month cancellation option. These items are carried at the value applicable on the balance sheet date.\n\nThe balance sheet shows cash and cash equivalents of EUR 697.1 million as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 652.8 million). In addition, other financial receivables include various bank deposits whose use is restricted (restricted funds, see section 4.7). The assets held for sale included no cash and cash equivalents as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 31.9 million).\n\n## 4.13 Equity\n\nShare capital totalled EUR 138.7 million as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 138.7 million). It is divided into 138,669,711 (31 December 2022: 138,669,711) zero par value shares, each of which represents a stake of EUR 1.00 in share capital. All shares are fully paid in.\n\nThe number of shares developed as follows:\n\n| Number of shares                               | 2023        | 2022        |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Balance at the beginning of the financial year | 138,669,711 | 123,293,795 |\n| Issue of shares                                | 0           | 15,375,916  |\n| Balance at the end of the financial year       | 138,669,711 | 138,669,711 |\n\nThe Executive Board is not aware of any agreements between shareholders of IMMOFINANZ AG that restrict voting rights or the transfer of shares. All shares are bearer shares and entitle the holders to participate in the annual general meeting and to exercise their voting rights. Each bearer share is entitled to one vote.\n\n{198}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Convertible bond and conditional capital\n\nIMMOFINANZ was informed on 3 December 2021 through a voting rights announcement in accordance with § 130 of the Austrian Stock Exchange Act of 2018 that CPI Property Group (\"CPIPG\") held an investment, directly and indirectly, of approximately 21.4% in the share capital of IMMOFINANZ AG. This investment gave CPIPG a controlling interest in IMMOFINANZ AG as defined in § 22 in connection with § 27 of the Austrian Takeover Act. The conversion price was therefore temporarily adjusted to EUR 18.8987 in accordance with the issue terms (before the adjustment: EUR 20.6333) up to the control date on 19 January 2022.\n\nThe capital increase from conversions totalled EUR 280.8 million and was serviced with 15,375,916 new shares. Due to the substantially reduced volume – a nominal value of only EUR 3.2 million was outstanding after the conversions – IMMOFINANZ called the convertible bond for premature redemption on 29 April 2022 in accordance with the issue terms.\n\nThe annual general meeting on 3 May 2023 authorised the Executive Board, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, pursuant to § 174 (2) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act to issue convertible bonds up to a total nominal value of EUR 618,092,498.00 which are connected with exchange and/or subscription rights for up to 69,334,855 bearer shares of the company with a proportional share of EUR 69,334,855.00 in share capital. These convertible bonds may be issued in multiple tranches and within a period of five years. Moreover, the Executive Board was authorised to determine all other conditions as well as the issue and exchange procedures for the convertible bonds. The convertible bonds can be issued in exchange for cash or contributions in kind. The subscription rights of shareholders are excluded.\n\nShare capital was conditionally increased by up to EUR 69,334,855.00 through the issue of up to 69,334,855 new bearer shares. The purpose of this conditional capital increase is the issue of shares to the holders of the convertible bonds which were issued in accordance with a resolution of the annual general meeting on 3 May 2023.\n\nThe authorisation for the issue of convertible bonds has not been used to date and is therefore available in full.\n\n#### Share buyback programme 2022\n\nIMMOFINANZ purchased 694,557 shares at a weighted average price of EUR 14.58 per share from 20 June 2022 to 29 July 2022 through the share buyback programme 2022. The total purchase price amounted to EUR 10,126,484.94.\n\nThe share buyback programme 2022 was based on § 65 (1) no. 8 of the Austrian Stock Exchange Act and executed in accordance with an authorisation of the annual general meeting on 1 October 2020 (which was renewed by an authorisation of the annual general meeting on 12 July 2022). The repurchased shares represent EUR 694,557.00, or roughly 0.5% of share capital.\n\nIMMOFINANZ held 695,585 treasury shares as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 695,585 treasury shares).\n\n#### Authorisations of the annual general meeting to purchase and sell treasury shares\n\nThe annual general meeting on 3 May 2023 authorised the Executive Board, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to repurchase the company's shares in accordance with § 65 (1) no. 8 and (1a) and (1b) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act at an amount equalling up to 10% of share capital during a period of 30 months. The shares may be purchased over the stock exchange or over the counter. The Executive Board was also authorised, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the proportional subscription rights of shareholders.\n\nThe Executive Board was also authorised, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to sell or use treasury shares in another manner than over the stock exchange or through a public offering in accordance with § 65 (1b) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act during a period of five years, whereby the proportional subscription rights of shareholders can be excluded.\n\n{199}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe authorisation for the purchase and sale of treasury shares has not been used to date and is therefore available in full.\n\n#### Authorised capital\n\nThe annual general meeting on 3 May 2023 authorised the Executive Board, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, pursuant to § 169 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act to increase the company's share capital by up to EUR 69,334,855.00 through the issue of up to 69,334,855 new shares in exchange for cash or contributions in kind. The authorisation is valid up to 21 July 2028. The Executive Board is also authorised, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the subscription rights of shareholders in full or in part. The shares issued based on this authorisation in exchange for cash contributions and under the exclusion of shareholders' subscription rights may not exceed EUR 13,866,971.00, which represents roughly 10% of the company's share capital at the time the resolution was passed by the annual general meeting.\n\nThis authorisation to increase share capital has not been used to date and is therefore available in full.\n\n{200}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 4.14 Financial liabilities\n\nThe following table shows the composition and remaining terms of the financial liabilities as of 31 December 2023 and 2022:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                             | 31 12 2023 | thereof re<br>maining term<br>under 1 year | thereof re<br>maining term<br>between<br>1 and 5 years | thereof re<br>maining term<br>over 5 years | 31 12 2022 | thereof re<br>maining term<br>under 1 year | thereof re<br>maining term<br>between<br>1 and 5 years | thereof re<br>maining term<br>over 5 years |\n|-------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Amounts due to financial in<br>stitutions       | 3,296,541  | 235,076                                    | 2,025,244                                              | 1,036,221                                  | 2,766,246  | 301,312                                    | 1,724,963                                              | 739,971                                    |\n| thereof secured by colla<br>teral               | 3,296,354  | 234,889                                    | 2,025,244                                              | 1,036,221                                  | 2,766,128  | 301,194                                    | 1,724,963                                              | 739,971                                    |\n| thereof not secured by<br>collateral            | 187        | 187                                        | 0                                                      | 0                                          | 118        | 118                                        | 0                                                      | 0                                          |\n| Liabilities arising from the is<br>sue of bonds | 820,539    | 120,810                                    | 573,189                                                | 126,540                                    | 922,825    | 208,684                                    | 530,090                                                | 184,051                                    |\n| Other financial liabilities                     | 166,451    | 76,872                                     | 40,571                                                 | 49,008                                     | 478,399    | 9,841                                      | 84,281                                                 | 384,277                                    |\n| Total                                           | 4,283,531  | 432,758                                    | 2,639,004                                              | 1,211,769                                  | 4,167,470  | 519,837                                    | 2,339,334                                              | 1,308,299                                  |\n\nThe liabilities from the issue of bonds represent fixed-interest, unsecured, non-subordinated bonds. They include one bond issued by IMMOFINANZ AG with an outstanding nominal value of EUR 237.8 million (31 December 2022: two bonds, nominal value of EUR 424.9 million) and nine bonds issued by S IMMO AG with a total outstanding nominal value of EUR 620.6 million (31 December 2022: eight bonds, nominal value: EUR 545.6 million). In 2022, the decline in the balance of bonds issued by IMMOFINANZ AG resulted from the change-of-control event which was triggered by the majority takeover by CPI Property Group. This changeof-control event entitled the bondholders to exercise their sale right at 101% of the nominal value plus accrued interest up to the sale date on 25 April 2022.

Consequently, all rights and obligations from these loans are attributable to the respective real estate company. These property loans include standard market obligations (hard financial covenants) for compliance with specific financial indicators by the property company, which generally involve:\n\n– Debt service coverage ratios\n\n– The ratio of the remaining debt to the market value of the property (loan-to-value)\n\nThe financing banks are entitled to call the outstanding loan prematurely in individual cases if the borrower fails to comply with specific financial covenants or does not implement contractually defined, accepted measures to remedy the situation. One covenant was breached as of 31 December 2023, and the related credit liability of EUR 6.7 million was therefore reclassified from other non-current to other current financial liabilities. In addition, one company failed to meet a legally defined equity ratio in 2023 and the banks in Slovakia were entitled to prematurely call the related loans. An amount of EUR 90.3 million was therefore reclassified from non-current to current financial liabilities. There were no covenant breaches in 2022.\n\n{202}------------------------------------------------\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                        | 31 12 2023 | thereof re-<br>maining

value of the expected settlement amount. The provision is based on the best estimate at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. The best estimate of the amount required to meet the present obligation is the amount the company would rationally pay to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date or to transfer the obligation to a third party at that time. The risks and uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances must be taken into account in determining the best estimate. Valuation is therefore based in part on expert opinions and, above all, on past experience, probabilities for the outcome of legal disputes or proceedings under tax law, future cost trends, assumptions over interest rates, etc.\n\n{203}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe provisions developed as follows in 2023:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                    | 2023   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Balance at the beginning of the financial year         | 32,155 |\n| Disposals following the sale of subsidiaries (see 2.5) | -3,871 |\n| Foreign exchange differences                           | -1     |\n| Additions                                              | 24,125 |\n| Disposals                                              | -2,648 |\n| Use                                                    | -7,397 |\n| Compounding                                            | 269    |\n| Reclassifications                                      | -343   |\n| Balance at the end of the financial year               | 42,289 |\n| thereof current                                        | 11,245 |\n| thereof non-current                                    | 31,044 |\n\nThis position includes provisions of EUR 28.7 million (2022: EUR 19.0 million) for legal proceedings, EUR 6.2 million (2022: EUR 7.9 million) for work outstanding and warranties following the transfer of properties in the core market of Germany, and other provisions. The other provisions consist primarily of provisions for tax risks (above all, withholding, VAT and property tax), contractual obligations and obligations to employees (e.g. for bonuses and unused vacation).\n\nRestitution proceedings are currently in progress over land on which a Romanian subsidiary constructed a shopping center and over parts of another parcel of land in Romania. Based on a recent, not yet binding, court decision, the provision for this issue was increased by EUR 10.5 million to EUR 26.4 million.\n\nThe use of provisions in 2023 was related, above all, to completions and warranty claims. Detailed information on the provisions for legal proceedings is not provided in accordance with IAS 37 because it could, under certain circumstances, seriously prejudice IMMOFINANZ Group's position.\n\nProvisions include the following for employees of S IMMO: provisions of EUR 0.5 million (2022: EUR 0.7 million) for entitlements to termination payments and provisions of EUR 0.5 million (2022: EUR 0.4 million) for entitlements to service anniversary bonuses. The actuarial calculation of these obligations was based on a discount rate of 2.95% to 3.03% (2022: 3.07% to 3.10%), an expected increase of 2.6% (2022: 2.6%) in salaries and wages, and a flat-rate discount of 0% to 26.0% (2022: 0% to 26.0%) for employee turnover. The requirement to create a provision for termination benefits is based on the applicable regulations under labour law. Legal regulations require S IMMO to make a one-off payment to employees who joined the company in Austria prior to 1 January 2003 in the event of termination by the employer or at retirement. The amount of the payment is dependent on the number of service years and the compensation at the end of employment and ranges from two to twelve months' wages/salaries.\n\n{204}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-204-0\"></span>5. Notes to the Consolidated Income Statement\n\n## 5.1 Results of asset management\n\n#### 5.1.1 Rental income\n\nThe following table shows the classification of rental income by asset class:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                               | 2023    | 2022    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Office                                                            | 244,338 | 132,483 |\n| Retail                                                            | 241,518 | 156,139 |\n| Other                                                             | 28,115  | 257     |\n| thereof hotel                                                     | 7,366   | 0       |\n| thereof residential                                               | 19,915  | 0       |\n| thereof other                                                     | 834     | 257     |\n| Income from non-performance-related components of operating costs | 19,630  | 11,291  |\n| Total                                                             | 533,601 | 300,170 |\n\nThe year-on-year increase in rental income resulted primarily from the full consolidation of S IMMO and from the acquisition of retail properties. S IMMO contributed EUR 200.9 million to rental income in 2023, whereby EUR 123.4 million is attributable to the office asset class, EUR 41.9 million to retail, EUR 27.5 million to other and EUR 8.3 million to non-performance related components.\n\nAll leases in which IMMOFINANZ Group serves as the lessor are classified as operating leases, and all leased property is therefore carried on IMMOFINANZ Group's balance sheet. The resulting rental income is distributed on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The lease term includes the non-cancellable contract periods as well as option periods when the exercise of the extension option is sufficiently certain at the beginning of the lease. Incentives granted for the conclusion or extension of leases (e.g. rent-free periods, reduced rents for a certain period, graduated rents that increase at fixed rates over the lease term, fit-outs for individual tenants or the assumption of relocation costs) are included in the determination of the fair value of investment property and recognised as an adjustment to rental income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Contractually agreed, inflation-based rental price adjustments are recognised when the adjustments take effect and not on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Contingent rental income (generally turnoverbased rents) is only recognised when it is realised. The contingent rental income totalled EUR 18.2 million in 2023 (2022: EUR 17.8 million) and is included in the rental income from the retail asset class. Penalties for the premature cancellation of leases amounted to EUR 4.6 million (2022: EUR 1.5 million).\n\nWhen renegotiation, additions or amendments lead to a material change in the cash flows realisable over the remaining term of a rental agreement, the previous accruals from incentive agreements – with the exception of fit-outs that will be reused – are derecognised as a reduction of rental income. If there is no material change in the rental agreement, the previously accrued incentives remain unchanged and are recognised on a straightline basis. The general rules for the recognition of rental income on the initial conclusion of a rental agreement also apply when there is a substantial change in the rental agreement.\n\n{205}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe rental income from the contracts in effect as of 31 December is as follows:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR   | 2023      | 2022      |\n|-----------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Within 1 year         | 498,661   | 338,262   |\n| Between 1 and 5 years | 1,172,767 | 741,185   |\n| Over 5 years          | 485,047   | 301,986   |\n| Total                 | 2,156,475 | 1,381,433 |\n\nFuture rental income shown was adjusted to exclude the contracts related to disposal groups and discontinued operations as of the balance sheet date. Special cancellation rights or additional rental income from turnoverbased rents are not included. The reported income from existing leases in IMMOFINANZ Group includes future index-based adjustments, whereby an average term of 15 years was applied to open-end rental contracts.\n\nRental income includes the revenues which are not contrasted by the provision of services in the narrower sense of the term, but only represents the reimbursement of costs connected with legal ownership of the property (i.e. property tax and building insurance). The income from the non-performance-related components of operating costs has been presented since 2021 independent of the office, retail and other asset classes. The revenues from advertising space and telecommunications equipment are also reported as rental income in accordance with IFRS 16. The rental income from property taxes and building insurance totalled EUR 19.6 million in 2023 (2022: EUR 11.3 million), and the revenues from advertising space and telecommunications equipment amounted to EUR 3.5 million (2022: EUR 3.8 million).\n\n#### 5.1.2 Operating costs charged to tenants and operating expenses\n\nThe income from operating costs charged to tenants represents revenue in the sense of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) and is recognised over time. Operating costs are generally charged on a monthly basis and do not include any material financing components. The segment report provides information on the allocation of revenue from operating costs charged to tenants to the individual IMMOFINANZ regional core markets (see section 3.6).\n\nThe income from operating costs charged to tenants totalled EUR 190.6 million in 2023 (2022: EUR 118.6 million). In individual countries (e.g. Hungary, Slovakia and Poland), this income also includes contractually agreed flat-rate administrative costs or mark-ups to operating costs that are also collected from tenants. Section 5.1.1, last paragraph, includes information on the income from operating costs charged to tenants, which is reported under rental income in accordance with IFRS 16.\n\nOperating expenses include EUR -225.9 million (2022: EUR -126.6 million) of operating costs which are charged to tenants as well as expenses of EUR -7.5 million (2022: EUR -9.4 million) from vacancies.\n\n#### 5.1.3 Expenses from investment property\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                | 2023    | 2022    |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Commission expenses                                | -2,499  | -372    |\n| Maintenance                                        | -27,961 | -21,826 |\n| Operating costs charged to building owners         | -17,221 | -14,709 |\n| Property marketing                                 | -2,719  | -6,382  |\n| Personnel expenses from asset management (see 5.7) | -9,706  | -4,977  |\n| Other expenses from asset management               | -4,276  | -3,924  |\n| Fit-out costs                                      | -1,661  | -3,770  |\n| Write-off of receivables from asset management     | -6,279  | -2,406  |\n| Other expenses                                     | -3,074  | -1,751  |\n| Total                                              | -75,396 | -60,117 |\n\nMaintenance costs are attributable to extraordinarily urgent measures at several office properties as well as regular building maintenance.\n\nConcessions made retroactively to tenants are recognised as write-offs to receivables. The increase in receivables write-offs resulted from the difficult financial situation of tenants in the gastronomy business in Poland. \n\n{206}------------------------------------------------\n\nRental deferrals granted for future periods are accounted for similar to rental incentives and are recognised to rental income over the remaining term of the underlying contract.\n\nGovernment grants are deducted directly from the related expenses (net method) in accordance with IAS 20.29. IMMOFINANZ Group received government grants of EUR 1.0 million in 2023 (2022: EUR 0.0 million).\n\n## 5.2 Results of owner-operated hotels\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                  | 2023    | 2022 |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------|------|\n| Income from owner-operated hotels                    | 70,023  | 0    |\n| Expenses from owner-operated hotels                  | -52,745 | 0    |\n| Depreciation and impairment on owner-operated hotels | -15,266 | 0    |\n| Total                                                | 2,012   | 0    |\n\nThe owner-operated properties represent hotels held by S IMMO Group, which was acquired in 2022.\n\n{207}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 5.3 Results of property sales\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                                        | 2023     | 2022    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|\n| Office                                                                     | 49,062   | 62,056  |\n| Retail                                                                     | 570      | 5,301   |\n| Other                                                                      | 302,442  | 2,897   |\n| Proceeds from property sales                                               | 352,074  | 70,254  |\n| Less carrying amount of sold properties                                    | -352,074 | -70,254 |\n| Net gain/loss from property sales                                          | 0        | 0       |\n| Results from deconsolidation (see 2.5)                                     | -35,219  | 5,443   |\n| Sales commissions                                                          | -1,288   | -1,114  |\n| Personnel expenses from property sales (see 5.7)                           | -728     | -474    |\n| Legal, auditing and consulting fees from property sales                    | -1,006   | -561    |\n| Income and expenses related to written-off receivables from property sales | 7,000    | -12,945 |\n| VAT adjustments from the sale of properties                                | -682     | -176    |\n| Other expenses                                                             | -2,389   | -899    |\n| Expenses from property sales                                               | 907      | -16,169 |\n| Revaluation results from properties sold and held for sale (see 5.8)       | -4,015   | 15,349  |\n| Total                                                                      | -38,327  | 4,623   |\n\nResults from the sale of properties show the income from asset deals involving IAS 40 and IFRS 5 properties. This income represents the fair value of the property on the transaction date and is therefore generally contrasted by a book value disposal of the same amount. The differences between the carrying amounts on the last balance sheet date and the last quarter prior to the sale are recorded under the revaluation results from standing investments, respectively property under construction. In contrast, the differences between the carrying amounts in the last quarter and the sale proceeds are recorded under the revaluation of investment property sold and held for sale. Real estate trading is not part of IMMOFINANZ Group's ordinary business activities. Therefore, the results of property sales do not represent revenue in the sense of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) but are classified as revenues from the sale of IAS 40 and IFRS 5 properties. Of the revenues recognised from property sales in 2023 (EUR 352.1 million), partial payment was received in 2022. As of 31 December 2023, the outstanding purchase price receivables from property sales totalled EUR 12.1 million (see section 4.7). The outstanding purchase price receivables from property sales reported as of 31 December 2022 (EUR 6.1 million) were paid in 2023.\n\nExpenses from property sales include all personnel and operating expenses directly related to the sale process for a property or property company.\n\nIncome of EUR 7.0 million from receivables previously written off involves the purchase price receivable from the sale of the Russian portfolio in 2017, which was scheduled for settlement in the first half of 2022. Due to the war in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation together with the resulting effects – above all the payment restrictions imposed by Russia – management classified this receivable as uncollectible and wrote off the full amount of EUR 12.9 million in 2022. A payment of EUR 7.0 million was received in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nRevaluation results reflect the adjustment of fair value when a property is sold and the valuation of investment property held for sale at the respective selling price.\n\n{208}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 5.4 Results of property development\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                                                                              | 2023    | 2022    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Proceeds from the sale of real estate inventories                                                                | 0       | 580     |\n| Cost of real estate inventories sold                                                                             | 0       | -512    |\n| Write-down related reversals of real estate inventories                                                          | 0       | 50      |\n| Write-down of real estate inventories                                                                            | -180    | -2,012  |\n| Income and expenses related to written-off purchase price receivables from the sale of real es- tate inventories | 0       | -1,014  |\n| Operating costs charged to building owners of real estate inventories                                            | 0       | -49     |\n| Other expenses from real estate inventories                                                                      | -1,788  | -3,914  |\n| Expenses from real estate inventories                                                                            | -1,968  | -6,939  |\n| Expenses from property development                                                                               | -2,831  | -3,261  |\n| Revaluation results from properties under construction (see 5.8)                                                 | -20,792 | -10,552 |\n| Total                                                                                                            | -25,591 | -20,684 |\n\nThe sale of real estate inventories is reported under income from property development. In accordance with IFRS 15, revenue is recognised over time when the performance provided leads to an asset with no alternative use for IMMOFINANZ Group and IMMOFINANZ Group has an enforceable right to payment for the performance transferred to date. This is regularly the case with residential properties which are sold during the planning or construction stage. In cases where these requirements are met, a proportional share of profit is recognised according to the percentage of completion (which represents the extent of performance provided) if the carrying amount of the involved property exceeds the agreed net realisable value less transaction costs.\n\nRevenue from the sale of properties with an alternative use or without an enforceable right to payment is still recognised at a point in time (i.e. with the transfer of economic ownership). This point in time is generally the date on which the property is transferred because it marks the transfer of opportunities and risks as well as economic control.\n\nThe following table classifies the proceeds from the sale of real estate inventories in 2023 according to the timing of revenue recognition:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                   | 2023 | 2022 |\n|---------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Revenue recognised at a point in time | 0    | 580  |\n| Income from derecognised liabilities  | 0    | 580  |\n\nThe allocation of revenue from the sale of real estate inventories to IMMOFINANZ Group's regional core markets is shown in the segment report (see section 3.6).\n\nThe impairment losses of EUR 2.0 million recognised to real estate inventories in 2022 consisted chiefly of the write-down of cancelled residential property sales in Germany to the net realisable value less transaction costs. The results of property development also include charges of EUR 1.0 million (2022: EUR 1.9 million) for personnel expenses.\n\n{209}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 5.5 Other operating income\n\nOther operating income comprises the following items:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                  | 2023  | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------|--------|\n| Expenses charged on                  | 460   | 188    |\n| Insurance compensation               | 670   | 1,461  |\n| Income from derecognised liabilities | 3,792 | 946    |\n| Reimbursement for penalties          | 397   | 183    |\n| Miscellaneous                        | 2,534 | 7,599  |\n| Total                                | 7,853 | 10,377 |\n\nThe share of S IMMO in other operating income equalled EUR 3.3 million in 2023. Miscellaneous other operating income in 2022 included income of EUR 6.5 million from the reimbursement of costs connected with the premature termination of a digitalisation project by CPI Property Group.\n\n## 5.6 Other operating expenses\n\nOther operating expenses include the following items:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                 | 2023    | 2022    |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Administrative expenses             | -5,657  | -2,983  |\n| Legal, auditing and consulting fees | -13,924 | -19,360 |\n| Penalties                           | -917    | -155    |\n| Taxes and levies                    | -4,517  | -2,495  |\n| Advertising                         | -3,113  | -3,689  |\n| EDP and communications              | -4,370  | -2,771  |\n| Expert opinions                     | -1,022  | -614    |\n| Personnel expenses (see 5.7)        | -23,469 | -25,967 |\n| Other write-downs                   | -4,335  | -2,128  |\n| Miscellaneous                       | -18,043 | -5,916  |\n| Total                               | -79,367 | -66,078 |\n\nThe full consolidation of S IMMO was responsible for EUR 35.3 million of other operating expenses in 2023.\n\nThe increase in administrative expenses resulted from the outsourcing of various activities to the service companies of the CPI Property Group and the related administrative charges. Directly attributable costs are reported under the respective functional operating area. If direct allocation is not possible, the administrative expenses are included under other operating expenses. Of the miscellaneous operating expenses, EUR 5.9 million (2022: EUR 3.0 million) represent administrative fees paid to CPI Property Group.\n\nThe decline in legal, auditing and consulting fees is attributable, above all, to the absence of costs recognised in 2022 for a Groupwide digitalisation project and to costs connected with the takeover offers by CPI Property Group and S IMMO.\n\nMiscellaneous other operating expenses include EUR 10.5 million arising from a court decision which is not yet legally binding and is related to restitution proceedings for land on which a Romanian subsidiary constructed a shopping center (also see section 4.16).\n\nOther write-downs include write-downs of EUR 0.5 million (2022: EUR 0.6 million) to right-of-use assets for other tangible assets (IFRS 16).\n\nThe costs for short-term leases and low-value leases equalled EUR 0.2 million in 2023 (2022: EUR 0.2 million). Other main components of miscellaneous other operating expenses were the costs connected with owner\n\n{210}------------------------------------------------\n\noperated properties, impairment losses and write-downs to other receivables, Supervisory Board remuneration and the costs for the annual general meeting as well as insurance premiums and costs for bank transactions.\n\nMiscellaneous other operating expenses also include TEUR 12.6 for research on office solutions in cooperation with Stanford University.

In cases where direct allocation is not possible, the personnel expenses are included under other operating expenses.\n\nThe average number of employees in the companies included in the consolidated financial statements totalled 250 in 2023 (2022: 301 employees). This statistic does not include employees on official leave (maternity, parental, military). The prior year data do not include any personnel expenses for S IMMO because that company was only fully consolidated as of 31 December 2022; the number of employees for 2022 does not include any S IMMO employees.\n\nS IMMO had a total workforce of 100 in 2023 (2022: 136 persons) excluding the employees in hotel operations, and 611 employees (2022: 583 persons) including the employees in hotel operations.\n\n{211}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 5.8 Revaluation results from investment property and goodwill\n\nThe results from the revaluation of investment properties and goodwill included valuation results of EUR - 352.0 million in 2023 (2022: EUR -110.5 million) and impairment losses to goodwill of EUR -0.2 million (2022: EUR -0.3 million). In 2022, this position also included a negative difference of EUR 214.6 million from the purchase of shares in S IMMO AG (see section 2.3).\n\nThe revaluation results from the standing investments include the revaluation of rights-of-use assets in accordance with IFRS 16 (EUR 0.2 million; 2022: EUR -1.4 million).\n\nThe following table shows the revaluation gains and losses on investment property:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR               | Revaluation gains | Revaluation losses | Total    | Revaluation gains | Revaluation losses | Total    |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|----------|-------------------|--------------------|----------|\n|                                   | 2023              |                    |          | 2022              |                    |          |\n| Investment property               | 235,727           | -587,761           | -352,034 | 91,218            | -201,717           | -110,499 |\n| Property under construction       | 1,380             | -22,172            | -20,793  | 6,125             | -16,677            | -10,552  |\n| Properties sold and held for sale | 170               | -4,185             | -4,015   | 15,762            | -413               | 15,349   |\n| Total                             | 237,277           | -614,118           | -376,841 | 113,105           | -218,807           | -105,702 |\n\nThe revaluation gains on investment property included EUR 117.7 million of purchase price adjustments that were deducted from the acquisition cost of real estate holding companies (see section 2.3). The remainder is primarily attributable to the revaluation of properties in the retail asset class.\n\nDetails on property under construction are provided in section 5.4, and details on property sold and held for sale can be found in section 5.3.\n\n## 5.9 Share of profit or loss from equity-accounted investments\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                    | Joint ventures | Associates | Total<br>2023 |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------|------------|---------------|\n| Share of profit or loss for the period | -189           | 6,053      | 5,864         |\n| Other adjustments                      | 0              | -5,526     | -5,526        |\n| Total                                  | -189           | 527        | 338           |\n\nOther adjustments include an impairment loss of EUR -5.5 million.\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                                        | Joint ventures | Associates | Total<br>2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------|---------------|\n| Share of profit or loss for the period                                     | 0              | 26,899     | 26,899        |\n| Other adjustments                                                          | 0              | -191,653   | -191,653      |\n| Reclassification of foreign exchange differences reserve to profit or loss | 0              | 1,925      | 1,925         |\n| Gains/losses on the sale of equity-accounted investments                   | 0              | 10,947     | 10,947        |\n| Total                                                                      | 0              | -151,882   | -151,882      |\n\nIn 2022, the share of profit or loss from equity-accounted investments included proportional results of EUR 19.8 million for the period from S IMMO, the carryforward of EUR 0.6 million in fair value adjustments identified in connection with the acquisition of the shares during the purchase price allocation as well as an impairment loss of EUR -192.2 million to the S IMMO investment from the transition consolidation. The transition consolidation involved the reclassification to profit or loss of EUR 12.9 million in differences from foreign currency translation and the change in the hedge accounting reserve. The total effect from S IMMO amounted to EUR 55.6 million and comprised EUR -159.0 million of results from the at-equity valuation of the investment and a negative difference of EUR 214.6 million (see section 2.3).\n\nAggregated financial information on the joint ventures and associates is presented in section 4.6.\n\n{212}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 5.10 Financial results\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                                                                     | 2023     | 2022     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| For financial liabilities AC                                                                            | -178,152 | -70,334  |\n| For derivative financial instruments                                                                    | -31,868  | -7,430   |\n| Total financing costs                                                                                   | -210,020 | -77,764  |\n| For financial receivables AC                                                                            | 12,036   | 1,669    |\n| For financial receivables FVPL                                                                          | 30       | 0        |\n| For derivative financial instruments                                                                    | 79,921   | 3,891    |\n| Total financing income                                                                                  | 91,987   | 5,560    |\n| Foreign exchange differences                                                                            | -8,845   | 2,333    |\n| Profit or loss on other financial instruments and proceeds on the disposal of financial instru<br>ments | -1,901   | -6,331   |\n| Valuation of financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss                                 | -118,980 | 156,263  |\n| Distributions                                                                                           | 1,316    | 798      |\n| Valuation adjustments and impairment of receivables                                                     | 76       | -64      |\n| Negative interest on cash and cash equivalents                                                          | -30      | -1,530   |\n| Other financial results                                                                                 | -119,519 | 149,136  |\n| Net profit or loss from equity-accounted investments (see 5.9)                                          | 338      | -151,882 |\n| Total                                                                                                   | -246,059 | -72,617  |\n\nAC: Financial assets/liabilities measured at amortised cost)\n\nThe financing costs for financial liabilities measured at amortised cost include interest expense of EUR -2.3 million (2022: EUR -1.9 million) for IFRS 16 lease liabilities.

IMMOFINANZ AG serves as the lead company of this group. The lead company and the members of the tax group concluded an agreement for the settlement of taxes, which was amended in 2011/12. Each member with positive results must pay a tax charge to the lead company. The charge equals 24% of the assessment base and is based on the tax rate defined in § 22 (1) of the Austrian Corporate Tax Act. Any losses by the group members are registered and can be offset in full against taxable profit recorded by the respective member in subsequent years. Group members with registered tax losses are not required to make payments to the lead company; no payments for (negative) charges are made by the lead company to the group members.\n\nAnother corporate tax group was established in 2009/10 pursuant to § 9 of the Austrian Corporate Tax Act. CPB Enterprise GmbH serves as the lead company of this group. Based on the group and tax assessment agreement concluded on 22 December 2009, the taxable income generated by the members of this group is allocated to CPB Enterprise GmbH, as the lead company of the group, after an offset against any pre-group losses. The group contract also calls for a tax charge as settlement for the transfer of taxable income. The tax \n\n{214}------------------------------------------------\n\ncharge procedure for this tax group is the same as the new tax charge agreement implemented for the IMMOFINANZ AG corporate group; it took effect starting in the 2011/12 financial year.\n\nS IMMO Group also had a corporate tax group pursuant to § 9 of the Austrian Corporate Tax Act with S IMMO AG as the lead company of this group. This tax group was integrated in the IMMOFINANZ tax group during 2023. Based on the tax assessment agreement concluded between the IMMOFINANZ AG and S IMMO companies, S IMMO AG with its subsidiaries forms a separate accounting entity for the tax charge. If S IMMO AG generates positive results, it is required to pay a (positive) tax charge to the head of the group equal to 20% of the assessment base. The generation of positive results by the S IMMO group members results in the payment of a (positive) tax charge to S IMMO AG equal to 24% of the assessment base. Losses incurred by the tax subgroup, respectively by the S IMMO group members are registered and can be offset in full against taxable profit recorded by the respective tax subgroup or S IMMO group member in subsequent years. Payments by S IMMO AG to the lead company or by an S IMMO group member to S IMMO AG are not required when registered losses are utilised. No payments for (negative) charges are made by the lead company to S IMMO AG or by S IMMO AG to the S IMMO group members.\n\n## 5.12 Earnings per share\n\nIn accordance with IAS 33, earnings per share are calculated by dividing net profit for the period attributable to the shareholders of IMMOFINANZ AG by the weighted average number of shares outstanding.\n\n|                                                                     | 2023         | 2022        |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Weighted average number of shares (basic)                           | 137,974,126  | 136,866,509 |\n| Weighted average number of shares (diluted)                         | 137,974,126  | 136,866,509 |\n| Net profit or loss (excl. non-controlling interests) in EUR         | -180,316,000 | 142,601,000 |\n| Net profit or loss excl. non-controlling interests in EUR (diluted) | -180,316,000 | 142,601,000 |\n| Basic earnings per share in EUR                                     | -1.31        | 1.04        |\n| Diluted earnings per share in EUR                                   | -1.31        | 1.04        |\n\nThere were no diluting effects in 2023 or in the previous year. The calculation of the number of shares as of 31 December 2023 included the 695,585 treasury shares held by IMMOFINANZ (31 December 2022: 695,585 shares).\n\n{215}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-215-0\"></span>6. Notes to the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement\n\nThe cash flow statement of IMMOFINANZ Group shows the changes in cash and cash equivalents resulting from the inflow and outflow of funds during the financial year. The cash flow statement distinguishes between cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Interest paid is reported under cash flow from financing activities, while interest and dividends received are reported under cash flow from investing activities. Cash flow from operating activities is calculated using the indirect method. Cash and cash equivalents comprise the following as of the balance sheet dates shown below:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                          | 31 12 2023 | 31 12 2022 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents (see 4.12)                         | 697,119    | 652,750    |\n| Cash and cash equivalents held by disposal groups (see 4.10) | 0          | 31,946     |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                    | 697,119    | 684,696    |\n\nForeign currency cash flows are translated at the weighted average exchange rate for the respective local currency and quarter. Translation differences arising from the use of this exchange rate and the mean exchange rate on the balance sheet date are charged or credited to foreign exchange differences.\n\nThe position \"business combinations and other acquisitions, net of cash and cash equivalents\" totalling EUR -1,023.9 million resulted almost entirely from transactions with CPI Property Group. Information on these transactions is provided in section 2.3.\n\n{216}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following table reconciles financial liabilities, derivatives and equity,

Other Disclosures\n\n## 7.1 Information on financial instruments\n\nThe primary financial instruments held by IMMOFINANZ Group which are reported under assets consist primarily of trade accounts receivable, financing receivables, loans and other receivables, real estate fund shares, miscellaneous other financial instruments and cash and cash equivalents. The primary financial instruments recorded under liabilities consist primarily of financial liabilities, liabilities arising from convertible bonds and trade accounts payable. The non-derivative financial instruments recorded under assets are carried at fair value through profit or loss (shares in other companies), at fair value through other comprehensive income (shares in other companies) or at amortised cost. Non-derivative financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost. Fair value is based on market prices or calculated in accordance with recognised valuation methods.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used to hedge the interest rate risk arising from business operations (see section 7.2.5).\n\n#### 7.1.1 Classes and categories of financial instruments\n\nIFRS 7 requires the breakdown of financial instruments by classes as well as the reconciliation of these classes with the line items shown on the balance sheet. Since the reporting company is entitled to define these classes, they generally differ from the categories defined by IFRS 9 for the measurement of financial instruments.\n\nThe definition of the reportable classes reflects the different characteristics of the major financial instruments held by IMMOFINANZ Group. Accordingly, similar financial instruments are grouped together into a class. The classes are also defined to facilitate reconciliation with the line items shown on the balance sheet. These factors led to the definition of the following classes: trade accounts receivable, financing receivables, loans and other receivables (including restricted funds), derivatives, miscellaneous other financial instruments and cash and cash equivalents (asset classes) as well as liabilities arising from bonds, liabilities with financial institutions, other financial liabilities, trade accounts payable, derivatives and miscellaneous other liabilities (liability classes).\n\nIn addition to the assignment of financial instruments to classes, IFRS 7 requires the disclosure of the carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities in accordance with the categories defined in IFRS 9. The following table presents the carrying amount and fair value of each class of financial assets and financial liabilities as well as each IFRS 9 category and reconciles these amounts to the appropriate balance sheet line items. Since the balance sheet positions \"trade and other receivables\" and \"trade and other liabilities\" can contain financial instruments as well as non-financial assets/liabilities (e.g. tax receivables), the column \"Non-FI\" allows for a full reconciliation with the balance sheet line.\n\n{219}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Assets

profit or loss\n\nAC: financial assets/liabilities measured at amortised cost Non-FI: non-financial assets/liabilities\n\nThe fair values shown in the above table were derived from stock exchange prices or determined by applying recognised valuation methods, depending on the class (see section 7.1.3).\n\nTrade account receivables are generally considered to be current or are carried net of any necessary valuation adjustments and, for this reason, fair value generally reflects the carrying amount. The same applies to cash and cash equivalents.\n\nThe fair value of financial receivables, loans and other receivables as well as the fair value of the miscellaneous other financial instruments also generally approximates the carrying amount because impairment losses have already been deducted.\n\nThe fair values shown in the above table for amounts due to financial institutions were calculated as the present value of future interest and principal payments. The discount rate includes a margin for IMMOFINANZ's own credit risk, and the valuation method used to determine fair value therefore represents Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 13. Information on the method used to determine the debt value adjustment is provided in section 7.1.3. The discount rates used to calculate the present value of the amounts due to financial institutions were based on the listing shown below, which reflects the market interest rates as of 31 December 2023 and the average credit spreads for the loans held as of the balance sheet date.\n\n|                      |        | 2023   |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Discount rates as of | min    | max    |\n| 1 1 2024             | 3.542% | 5.042% |\n| 1 1 2025             | 3.134% | 4.634% |\n| 1 1 2026             | 3.714% | 5.214% |\n| 1 1 2027             | 3.629% | 5.129% |\n| 1 1 2028             | 3.606% | 5.106% |\n| 1 1 2029             | 3.611% | 5.111% |\n| 1 1 2030             | 3.625% | 5.125% |\n| 1 1 2031             | 3.651% | 5.151% |\n| 1 1 2032             | 3.679% | 5.179% |\n| 1 1 2033             | 3.713% | 5.213% |\n\nThe fair value of the bonds is based on the market price or, for inactive markets, the present value of future interest payments. The fair value of the miscellaneous other liabilities corresponds to the present value (financial liabilities) or to the carrying amount (all other cases).\n\n{221}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 7.1.2 Net gains and losses\n\nThe net gains and losses which must be presented in accordance with IFRS 7 for each category of financial instrument defined in IFRS 9 comprise the following:\n\n|                                                                       |                              |                                         |                       | 31 12 2023    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|\n| All amounts in TEUR                                                   | Measurement<br>at fair value | Income from<br>disposals/<br>repurchase | Other<br>gains/losses | Net gain/loss |\n| FVOCI                                                                 | 1,187                        | 0                                       | 535                   | 1,722         |\n| thereof recognised to the consolidated income state-<br>ment          | 0                            | 0                                       | 535                   | 535           |\n| thereof designated and recorded under other compre-<br>hensive income | 1,187                        | 0                                       | 0                     | 1,187         |\n| FA-FVPL                                                               | -119,029                     | 0                                       | 484                   | -118,545      |\n| thereof mandatory                                                     | -119,029                     | 0                                       | 484                   | -118,545      |\n| FL-FVPL                                                               | 49                           | 0                                       | 0                     | 49            |\n| thereof mandatory                                                     | 49                           | 0                                       | 0                     | 49            |\n| FL-AC                                                                 | 0                            | 0                                       | -1,604                | -1,604        |\n\nFVOCI: financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income FA-FVPL/FL-FVPL: financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss FA-AC/FL-AC: financial assets/liabilities measured at amortised cost\n\nFA-AC/FL-AC: financial assets/liabilities measured at amortised cost\n\n#### 31 12 2022\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                               | Measurement<br>at fair value | Income from<br>disposals/<br>repurchase | Other<br>gains/losses | Net gain/loss |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|\n| FVOCI                                             | -2,537                       | 0                                       | 0                     | -2,537        |\n| thereof recorded under other comprehensive income | -2,537                       | 0                                       | 0                     | -2,537        |\n| FA-FVPL                                           | 156,263                      | 0                                       | 797                   | 157,060       |\n| thereof mandatory                                 | 156,263                      | 0                                       | 797                   | 157,060       |\n| FL-AC                                             | 0                            | -5,580                                  | -750                  | -6,330        |\n\nInformation on interest expense and interest income is provided in section 5.10.\n\n#### 7.1.3 Hierarchy of financial instruments carried at fair value\n\nThe following section includes an analysis of the financial instruments carried at fair value.

The interest rates used to discount the future cash flows are based on an interest curve that is observable on the market. The following three parameters are required to calculate the credit value adjustment (CVA) and the debt value adjustment (DVA): the probability of default (PD), the loss given default (LGD) and the exposure at default (EAD). The probability of default is derived from the credit default swap (CDS) spreads of the respective counterparty. Derivatives with a positive fair value represent receivables for IMMOFINANZ Group; in these cases, a CVA calculation is used to calculate the amount of the receivable. One parameter for this calculation is the probability of default for the counterparty. IMMOFINANZ Group contracts with over 15 financial institutions, and observable CDS spreads are available on the market for many of them. In exceptional cases, average branch benchmarks are used as a substitute for unavailable spreads. These benchmarks represent Level 1 and 2 input factors on the fair value measurement hierarchy. Derivatives with a negative fair value represent liabilities for IMMOFINANZ Group; in these cases, a DVA calculation is used to calculate the amount of the liability and the own probability of default must be determined. IMMOFINANZ Group generally concludes derivatives at the level of the property company that manages a particular property. Neither observable market CDS spreads, nor benchmarks are available for these property companies. Credit margins are therefore used to estimate CDS spreads which, in turn, form the basis for deriving the probability of default. The determination of the credit margins includes information from signed credit agreements and term sheets as well as indicative credit margin offers from banks based on the respective countries and asset classes. The plausibility of the calculated credit margins is also verified by comparison with external market reports. This procedure results in market-conform credit margins that can be used as estimates for valuing the company's own credit risk. These input factors represent Level 3 on the IFRS 13 measurement hierarchy. The loss given default (LGD) is the relative value that would be lost on default. IMMOFINANZ Group uses an ordinary market default rate to calculate the CVA and DVA. The exposure at default represents the expected \n\n{223}------------------------------------------------\n\namount of the asset or liability at the time of default. The calculation of the exposure at the time of default is based on a Monte Carlo simulation.\n\nFor net present value methods, an increase in the discount rate, exit yield or counterparty CDS values leads to a reduction in fair value. In contrast, fair value is increased by a reduction of these input factors.\n\nThe valuation of default risk includes assumptions for the probability of default, loss rate and the outstanding amount at the time of expected default. An increase in the probability of default and the loss rate will reduce the fair value of a derivative with a positive outstanding amount (receivable) and reduce the liability for a derivative with a negative outstanding amount (liability). A decrease in the probability of default and the loss rate leads to the opposite effect.\n\n{224}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 7.1.4 Collateral\n\nThe collateral for loans related to project financing is normally provided by the respective group company. Financing is generally concluded at the individual project level. As security for the loan, the lending bank receives a package of collateral that can be used to satisfy its receivables in the event a loan is called. This security package can include the following types of collateral:\n\n- Mortgage on the land or the land and the building\n- Pledge of shares in the project company\n- Pledge of receivables (from rental agreements, insurance contracts, property management contracts etc.)\n- Pledge of bank accounts (accounts for rental payments or other project-related accounts)\n- Promissory notes\n- Shares in subsidiaries\n\nThe conditions, type and scope of collateral are defined on an individual basis (for each company and property) and are dependent on the project volume and the amount and term of the loan.\n\nInvestment property with a carrying amount of EUR 6,562.8 million (31 December 2022: EUR 6,257.2 million) was pledged as collateral for debt financing of EUR 3,420.4 million (31 December 2022: EUR 2,899.3 million).\n\nNo property under construction was pledged as collateral as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: collateral with a total carrying amount of EUR 72.3 million for debt financing of EUR 30.1 million).\n\nFor property financing concluded by IMMOFINANZ Group, shares in the respective subsidiary serve as additional collateral in 77 cases (31 December 2022: 50 cases). The limitations on disposal end when the financial liability is repaid or when other collateral is provided.\n\nIn 2023 and in previous years, IMMOFINANZ Group accepted liabilities or guarantees on behalf of third parties with a maximum risk of EUR 15.6 million (31 December 2022: EUR 12.6 million). The probability of occurrence for these contingent liabilities is linked to the fulfilment or non-fulfilment of future conditions and was considered low as of the balance sheet date.\n\n## 7.2 Financial risk management\n\n#### 7.2.1 General information\n\nIMMOFINANZ has integrated an active risk management system into its operating processes and reporting paths. This system supports the rapid implementation of measures to counter risk and also has a direct influence on strategic decisions and operating processes. Internal guidelines, reporting systems and control measures have been installed throughout the corporation to support the monitoring, evaluation and control of risks related to the operating business. Risk management is a staff function which reports directly to the Executive Board. It autonomously monitors the corporate risks, aggregates risk data and reports, and actively supports the department and country organisations in the identification of risks and the implementation of economically suitable countermeasures. At the department and country organisation levels, the department head or country manager are responsible for risk management. The department heads and country managers report their risk positions to the Executive Board at least once each quarter, whereby acute risks are communicated immediately. IMMOFINANZ also works to continuously improve the internal control system (ICS) to support the early identification and monitoring of risks. A description of the ICS is provided in the management report.\n\n{225}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs an international corporation, IMMOFINANZ Group is exposed to various financial risks. The major financial risks for the Group arise from possible changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates and from the deterioration of the credit standing and solvency of its customers and business partners.\n\n#### 7.2.2 Default/credit risk\n\nDefault or credit risks arise from the possibility that the counterparty to a transaction could fail to meet the related obligations and IMMOFINANZ Group incurs financial damages as a result. The maximum credit risk represents the carrying amounts reported under assets on the balance sheet. Default risk is reflected in appropriate valuation adjustments.\n\nThe most important instrument for managing default risk is the continuous evaluation of the credit standing of contract partners. In various development projects, IMMOFINANZ Group works together with local project developers. This cooperation can represent a risk for IMMOFINANZ Group if the business partners are unable to meet their contractual obligations in full or on time. Appropriate contractual provisions – e.g. penalties or damage payments in cases where performance does not meet the contract terms – are used to address this risk. In addition, activities and goal attainment are monitored regularly by IMMOFINANZ Group's development department.\n\nThe risk of default on receivables due from tenants is generally low because tenants are regularly required to provide security deposits – cash deposits for residential properties, bank guarantees or cash deposits for commercial properties – and their credit standing is monitored on a regular basis. Individual valuation adjustments are generally recorded to receivables that are exposed to an increased risk of default.\n\nThe default risk associated with receivables due from banks is also considered to be low because all financing transactions are concluded with financial institutions that have excellent credit ratings. Counterparty and concentration risks are limited by continuous monitoring, fixed investment limits and the diversification of financial institutions. Banks are aggregated into a banking group and evaluated according to a common default probability. Receivables are combined and reviewed against appropriate limits.\n\nA default event is assumed to occur when the debtor is not expected to meet his or her credit obligations in full. A receivable is written off (derecognised) when it is overdue more than 365 days and collection measures have ceased or when the receivable is considered uncollectible in full even if it is not overdue more than one year.\n\nFinancial receivables are assigned to the following classes of financial instruments in IMMOFINANZ Group:\n\n- Trade accounts receivable\n- Financing receivables\n\n– Loans and other receivables\n\nThe next two tables present the following information in summarised form: the gross amount for each category of receivables as of the balance sheet date, the recognised impairment losses and resulting net receivables, a reconciliation of the beginning balance to the ending balance of the valuation allowances, and explanatory comments on the creation of the valuation allowances for each of the three receivables classes.\n\n{226}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                             | 2023                |            |                | 2022                |            |                |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------|------------|----------------|---------------------|------------|----------------|\n| All amounts in TEUR         | Gross<br>receivable | Impairment | Net receivable | Gross<br>receivable | Impairment | Net receivable |\n| Trade accounts receivable   | 99,990              | -19,098    | 80,892         | 88,075              | -14,851    | 73,224         |\n| Financing receivables       | 7,767               | -3,835     | 3,932          | 8,241               | -3,835     | 4,406          |\n| Loans and other receivables | 141,901             | -6,855     | 135,046        | 123,404             | -13,625    | 109,779        |\n| Total                       | 249,658             | -29,788    | 219,870        | 219,720             | -32,311    | 187,409        |\n\n#### Valuation allowances for trade accounts receivable\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                 | 2023    | 2022    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Beginning balance                                   | -14,851 | -13,248 |\n| Currency translation adjustments                    | -686    | 52      |\n| Additions following the acquisition of subsidiaries | -205    | -3,669  |\n| Write-offs                                          | 2,362   | 5,776   |\n| Revaluation                                         | -6,284  | -3,753  |\n| Reclassifications and other developments            | 566     | -9      |\n| Ending balance                                      | -19,098 | -14,851 |\n\nThe trade accounts receivable held by IMMOFINANZ Group comprise rents receivable, operating costs receivable and receivables from the sale of real estate inventories. The calculation of impairment for all these receivables is based on the simplified approach defined by IFRS 9.5.5.15, which requires the recognition of a loss allowance equal to the lifetime expected credit losses as of the initial recognition date as well as in subsequent periods. The application of the simplified approach to rents receivable, which represent lease receivables, is based on the option provided by this standard. The remaining trade receivables fall within the scope of application of IFRS 15 and do not include any material financing components. The application of the simplified approach is therefore mandatory.\n\nImpairment losses are based on historical experience in accordance with the number of days overdue. However, the calculation also includes more specific information on expected return flows or forward-looking assumptions if this information is available and if it is assumed that these factors will influence the amount of the impairment loss. Impairment losses were not recognised to the outstanding receivables of EUR 0.3 million (31 December 2022: EUR 0.9 million) from the sale of real estate inventories, which are reported as part of trade receivables, because the available collateral is considered sufficient.\n\nThe following table shows the gross receivables and impairment losses recognised for rents and operating costs receivable based on the time overdue as of 31 December 2023 as well as the average impairment in relation (%) to the average time overdue as of 31 December 2018, 2019, 2021 and 2022 (2020 was not included in the comparative data due to distortions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic):\n\n| All amounts in TEUR           | Gross receivable | Impairment | Impairment in % | Average impairment in<br>prior years |\n|-------------------------------|------------------|------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Not due until 90 days overdue | 79,459           | -3,553     | 4.47%           | 3.50%                                |\n| 91- 365 days overdue          | 7,798            | -4,049     | 51.93%          | 57.72%                               |\n| More than 365 days overdue    | 12,734           | -11,499    | 90.31%          | 97.12%                               |\n| Ending balance                | 99,990           | -19,102    |                 |                                      |\n\n{227}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Valuation allowances for financing receivables\n\n| All amounts in TEUR | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|\n| Beginning balance   | -3,835 | -3,835 |\n| Ending balance      | -3,835 | -3,835 |\n\nFinancing receivables consist primarily of financing for property companies which is collateralised by the property and the related return flows. Consequently, impairment losses were generally not required for these items.

These deposits with financial institutions have only a minimal risk of default, and it can therefore be assumed that the default risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition. The credit loss expected within the next 12 months was therefore determined in accordance with IFRS 9. For the remaining other receivables, an impairment loss was not required due to available collateral or an impairment loss was recognised because of an assumed default event at the amount of the expected loss over the lifetime of the financial instrument.\n\n#### 7.2.3 Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risks are minimised by careful planning with regular variance analyses. Daily liquidity management ensures that all operating obligations can be met and funds can be optimally invested, and also gives the Group the necessary flexibility to realise short-term acquisition opportunities.\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group also uses long-term financing in which the financial capability of the individual properties (interest coverage ratio, debt service coverage ratio) and present value (loan-to-value ratio) are reflected in appropriate contract clauses.\n\nIn order to prevent cost overruns and the resulting excess outflow of liquidity, IMMOFINANZ Group routinely monitors budgets and the progress of construction on all development projects and maintenance work.\n\nThe following table shows the term structure of derivative and non-derivative financial liabilities based on the contractually defined outflow of funds. In particular, the reported amounts include current and bullet repayments for financial liabilities, interest payments and net payments from derivatives. There were no derivative financial liabilities on record as of 31 December 2022 due to the strong positive development of the respective market values during the 2022 financial year.\n\n{228}------------------------------------------------\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                | Cash outflows<br>(-) / Cash in-<br>flows (+) under<br>1 year | Cash

Property Group, lease liabilities, trade accounts payable and liabilities from deposits received.\n\nThe amounts due to financial institutions by IMMOFINANZ Group are broadly diversified by region and counterparty, and the exposure to a change in the risk policy of an individual financial institution is therefore considered low.\n\nOn 9 June 2021, Czech Property Investments, a.s, (CPI CZ), CPI FIM S.A. (CPI FIM) – both wholly owned subsidiaries of CPI Property Group S.A. (CPIPG) – and UniCredit Bank Czech Republic and Slovakia a.s. (UniCredit) concluded a credit agreement over EUR 213,235,000.\n\nThis financing is related to properties acquired by CPI Property Group S.A. through share deals in the fourth quarter of 2023. In connection with the purchase transaction, SC Czech AHG, s.r.o. (S IMMO CZ) - a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of S IMMO AG – stated its intention to serve as joint debtor, effective as of 23 November 2023, and furthermore, to accept the terms of the facility agreement as a borrower and to be jointly and severally liable together with CPI CZ and CPI FIM.\n\nConsequently, S IMMO CZ is primarily responsible for the repayment of the loan, the payment of interest on the loan and all other payment obligations arising from the facility agreement. The existing loan liability is, therefore, recorded in full in the consolidated financial statements of IMMOFINANZ Group; there is no liability for the loans payable recognised by CPI CZ or CPI FIM S.A. Based on the joint and several liability for this loan and the cross-default clauses in the loan agreement, S IMMO CZ is exposed to the risk of possible default/possible insolvency by CPI CZ or CPI FIM because the financing bank would be entitled to call the loan in this case. However, this risk is considered low because S IMMO CZ has all rights to remedy a possible default by CPI CZ/CPI FIM (the cross-default clause in the loan agreement is limited to CPI CZ and CPI FIM). Any damages incurred by S IMMO CZ from a possible default in this connection are secured by a guarantee at first request which was provided by the parent company CPIPG.\n\n#### 7.2.4 Foreign exchange risk\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group is exposed to various forms of foreign exchange risk in connection with its accounting data and cash flows. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can influence the Group's earnings position and also have an impact on the Group's asset position.\n\n{229}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Effect on the asset and earnings position\n\nThe individual Group companies record transactions in a currency that differs from their functional currency at the mean exchange rate on the date of the respective transaction. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the mean exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. The resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss for the financial year.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, all liabilities to financial institutions were denominated in euros.\n\nThe risk of devaluation associated with foreign currency bank deposits and cash balances is offset by the earliest possible conversion of these funds into the euro.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used in some cases to manage the low structural foreign exchange risk. The derivative financial instruments used by IMMOFINANZ Group to hedge this risk are recorded as standalone derivatives and not as hedging instruments. Hedge accounting as defined in IFRS 9 is not applied and, therefore, the stand-alone derivatives are measured through profit or loss.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, no derivatives were held to hedge foreign exchange risk.\n\nCash and cash equivalents are held in the following currencies:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR | 31 12 2023 | 31 12 2022 |\n|---------------------|------------|------------|\n| EUR                 | 581,691    | 552,806    |\n| PLN                 | 36,205     | 33,186     |\n| RON                 | 26,751     | 32,956     |\n| HUF                 | 32,353     | 17,790     |\n| CZK                 | 8,490      | 6,578      |\n| RSD                 | 11,585     | 5,328      |\n| Other               | 44         | 4,106      |\n| Total               | 697,119    | 652,750    |\n\n#### 7.2.5 Interest rate risk\n\nAs an international corporation, IMMOFINANZ Group is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations on real estate submarkets. Increases in interest rates can have a negative impact on Group earnings by increasing the cost of floating rate financing.\n\nA change in interest rates has a direct influence on financial results through its impact on floating rate financing. IMMOFINANZ Group limits the risk associated with rising interest rates – which would lead to higher interest expense and a decline in financial results – through the use of fixed interest rate financing contracts and derivative financial instruments (above all swaps). These derivative financial instruments are accounted for as stand-alone derivatives and not as hedging instruments in the sense of IFRS 9.\n\nThe following table shows the classification of financial liabilities by type of interest rate:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                          | 31 12 2023 | 31 12 2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Fixed interest financial liabilities         | 986,990    | 1,063,776  |\n| Floating rate financial liabilities          | 3,296,541  | 3,103,694  |\n| Total interest-bearing financial liabilities | 4,283,531  | 4,167,470  |\n\nOf the floating rate financial liabilities, a nominal value of EUR 3,088.4 million (31 December 2022: EUR 2,561.1 million) is hedged through interest rate swaps. This results in a fixed interest rate based on the combined interest effect of the financial liability and the derivative. Financial liabilities with a nominal value of EUR 19.9 million (31 December 2022: EUR 139.9 million) are hedged with caps.\n\n{230}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following table shows the fair values and conditions of all derivative financial instruments that were purchased and held as of 31 December 2023 to hedge interest rates:\n\n|

for derivatives outstanding as of the balance sheet date. The fair value represents the amount that the respective company would receive or be required to pay if the transaction were terminated as of the balance sheet date.\n\nA change in the market interest rate will influence the valuation of interest rate derivatives. Net present value calculations based on the DCF method – which is also used to value derivatives – discount future cash flows with current interest rate curves to determine market value. Rising interest rates lead to a higher discount factor and to a reduction in the present value of the derivative. Sensitivity analyses are used to illustrate the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations. They show the effects of changes in market interest rates on market values and interest payments as well as interest income and expense.\n\nThe following sensitivity analysis shows the effects of a change in the interest rate level on the fair value of the interest rate derivatives. An increase, respectively decrease of 50 and 100 basis points was assumed. The fair values exclude both accrued interest and credit risk premiums.\n\n{231}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Other Disclosures\n\n| Sensitivity of derivatives                    |            | Interest rate        |                       |  |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--|\n| All amounts in TEUR                           | 31 12 2023 | ∆ 50 basis<br>points | ∆ 100 basis<br>points |  |\n| Fair value based on increase in interest rate | 122,405    | 176,734              | 229,356               |  |\n| Fair value based on decrease in interest rate | 122,405    | 66,310               | 8,444                 |  |\n\n| Sensitivity of derivatives                    |            | Interest rate                  |                                 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| All amounts in TEUR                           | 31 12 2022 | $\\triangle$ 50 basis<br>points | $\\triangle$ 100 basis<br>points |\n| Fair value based on increase in interest rate | 241,190    | 287,502                        | 333,000                         |\n| Fair value based on decrease in interest rate | 241,190    | 192,030                        | 142,099                         |\n\nA further sensitivity analysis shows the influence of floating interest rates on the interest expense associated with financial liabilities.

The current financing receivables generally carry fixed interest rates and, consequently, they carry no or only limited interest rate risk.\n\n{232}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 7.2.6 Capital management\n\nThe goal set by IMMOFINANZ Group's management is to protect the Group's short-, medium- and long-term liquidity and to create and maintain a strong capital base in order to earn the trust of investors, creditors and the markets and safeguard the Group's sustainable positive development. The Executive Board regularly monitors the development of the share price, the discount of the share price to net asset value (net tangible assets, NTA), and the amount of recommended dividend payments to the shareholders of IMMOFINANZ AG.\n\nThe Group's capital structure is determined by financial liabilities and by equity (excluding treasury shares) of EUR 7,953.3 million. IMMOFINANZ Group intends to further optimise its capital structure by arranging for new financing and by terminating, extending or restructuring older financing. The average financing costs for IMMOFINANZ, including derivatives used for interest rate hedging, equalled 2.9% in 2023 (2022: 2.6%).\n\nThe Executive Board monitors the Group's capital structure by means of the LTV ratio. This indicator shows the relation between financial liabilities less cash and cash equivalents and the value of the real estate portfolio plus properties held for sale. The LTV ratio equalled 42.2% as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 40.7%).\n\nGearing (secured and unsecured) and the interest coverage ratio also represent a minimum capital requirement by external stakeholders. All requirements were met during the 2023 financial year.\n\n## 7.3 Financial obligations\n\n#### 7.3.1 Contingent liabilities and guarantees\n\nContingent liabilities represent possible or existing obligations arising from past events, in cases where it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation (also see section 7.1).\n\nThe contingent liabilities arising from sureties, guarantees and other liabilities that are not recognised on IM-MOFINANZ Group's balance sheet are evaluated regularly with respect to the probability of their occurrence. If an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is neither sufficiently probable to require the recognition of a provision nor improbable, the obligations are recognised as contingent liabilities. The estimates are made by specialists based on market-related inputs (where possible) and expert opinions (in individual cases).\n\nA preliminary injunction over the shares in a Romanian subsidiary (carrying amount of net assets: EUR 92.4 million; 31 December 2022: EUR 85.9 million) was in effect as of 31 December 2023 and limits the power to dispose over these shares. The involved subsidiary remains under IMMOFINANZ Group's control and is included in the consolidated financial statements through full consolidation. Moreover, legal uncertainty can arise in connection with land ownership in individual East European countries (e.g. Romania).\n\nThe assessment of risks related to uncertainties over income tax treatments as of 31 December 2023 identified two issues in Germany and Poland. IMMOFINANZ Group evaluated the basis for the accounting treatment of the related tax risks by way of scenario analyses and estimates from the involved attorneys and tax advisors. This led to the conclusion that the recognised risks have been appropriately included since the start of the proceedings. Following these analyses, it is still assumed that the tax authorities will acknowledge the procedural uncertainties of EUR 16.3 million (31 December 2022: EUR 11.3 million) in favour of the taxpayer and cancel the findings by the fiscal authorities. Since the decisions of tax authorities in Austria and other countries are not easy to predict and the refund of payments previously made is not considered sufficiently probable for the recognition of a contingent receivable, these items were not included in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2023.\n\n{233}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 7.3.2 Other financial obligations\n\nThe following table shows the financial obligations arising from previously contracted construction services, maintenance and other contractual obligations for the construction or acquisition of properties:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                                       | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Outstanding construction costs                                            | 32,534 | 40,241 |\n| Contracted maintenance                                                    | 3,538  | 3,833  |\n| Contractual obligations for the construction or acquisition of properties | 6,080  | 18,929 |\n| Total                                                                     | 42,152 | 63,003 |\n\nContractual obligations for the construction or acquisition of properties include EUR 6.1 million (31 December 2022: EUR 18.9 million) for S IMMO Group.\n\n## 7.4 Transactions with related parties\n\nRelated parties in the sense of IAS 24 include all subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates (see section 8.). In addition to persons who have a controlling or significant influence over IMMOFINANZ Group, related parties include the members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of IMMOFINANZ AG and CPI Property Group, as well as their close family members. CPI Property Group is also considered a related party due to its majority shareholding.\n\nAs part of the remuneration for the members of the Executive Board, IMMOFINANZ AG makes payments to APK Pensionskasse AG. These payments are related to company pensions for the Executive Board members and reflect standard market conditions. The contributions made in 2023 are reported in section 7.4.2.\n\nTransactions between fully consolidated subsidiaries are eliminated during the consolidation and are therefore not explained in detail.\n\nThe following transactions were carried out with the CPI Property Group in 2023:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR               | 31 12 2023 | 31 12 2022 |\n|-----------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Relations with CPI Property Group |            |            |\n| Receivables                       | 12,481     | 13,063     |\n| Liabilities                       | 39,364     | 342,871    |\n| All amounts in TEUR               | 2023       | 2022       |\n| Relations with CPI Property Group |            |            |\n| Other income                      | 2,536      | 6,577      |\n| Other expenses                    | -23,791    | -5,452     |\n| Interest income                   | 21         | 0          |\n| Interest expense                  | -12,072    | -190       |\n\nIMMOFINANZ AG concluded a framework service agreement with CPI Property Group S.A. which covers the provision of asset management services and administrative services (accounting, tax, controlling, HR, legal, financial, IT) by the local management companies of CPI Property Group S.A. for the local property companies of IMMOFINANZ AG in selected CEE countries. The details for the provision of these services and the amount of the service fees are regulated by implementing agreements concluded between the local CPI management companies and the local property holding companies of IMMOFINANZ AG in the Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary, Serbia, Croatia and Italy. Various transactions were also concluded with CPI Property Group in 2023. The information on these transactions is provided in section 2.3.\n\n{234}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 7.4.1 Joint ventures and associates\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                 | 31 12 2023 | 31 12 2022 |\n|-------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Relations with associated companies |            |            |\n| Receivables                         | 0          | 2          |\n| Liabilities                         | 0          | 214        |\n| All amounts in TEUR                 | 2023       | 2022       |\n| Relations with associated companies |            |            |\n| Other income                        | 237        | 800        |\n| Other expenses                      | -2,581     | -2,895     |\n\nTransactions with joint ventures and associates are carried out at standard market prices and conditions. The financing for joint ventures is frequently arranged between IMMOFINANZ Group and its co-investors at a ratio that differs from the respective interest in capital.\n\n#### 7.4.2 Members of management in key positions\n\nThe members of management in key positions as defined in IAS 24 are active solely in the corporate bodies of IMMOFINANZ AG and include the following persons:\n\n#### Executive Board\n\nRadka Doehring – Executive Chairwoman since 1 May 2022 Pavel Měchura – Member since 16 June 2023\n\nDietmar Reindl – Member of the Executive Board, Property Management, up to 8 June 2022 Stefan Schönauer – Member of the Executive Board, Finance, up to 8 June 2022\n\n#### Supervisory Board\n\nMiroslava Greštiaková – Chairwoman since 31 March 2022 Martin Němeček – Vice-Chairman since 31 March 2022 Gayatri Narayan – Member up to 31 December 2023\n\nBettina Breiteneder – Chairwoman up to 31 March 2022 Sven Bienert – Vice-Chairwoman up to 31 March 2022 Michael Mendel – Vice-Chairman from 19 October 2021 to 31 March 2022 Dorothee Deuring – Member from 19 October 2021 to 31 March 2022 Stefan Guetter – Member from 19 October 2021 to 15 July 2022 Martin Matula – Member since 16 July 2022\n\n#### Members delegated to the Supervisory Board by the Works Council\n\nThe following persons were delegated to the Supervisory Board by the Works Council of IMMOFINANZ AG: Philipp Amadeus Obermair – Member Anton Weichselbaum – Member since 3 May 2023 Werner Ertelthalner – Member up to 3 May 2023\n\nRita Macskasi-Temesvary – Member from 19 October 2021 to 31 March 2022\n\n{235}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                              |                      |                    | 2023  |                      |                    | 2022  |\n|------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|-------|----------------------|--------------------|-------|\n| All amounts in TEUR          | Supervisory<br>Board | Executive<br>Board | Total | Supervisory<br>Board | Executive<br>Board | Total |\n| Short-term employee benefits | 230                  | 744                | 974   | 230                  | 2,035              | 2,265 |\n| Post-employment benefits     | -                    | 53                 | 53    | -                    | 175                | 175   |\n| Termination benefits         | -                    | -                  | -     | -                    | 6,097              | 6,097 |\n| Total                        | 230                  | 797                | 1,027 | 230                  | 8,307              | 8,537 |\n\nThe members of management in key positions received the following remuneration:\n\nThe short-term employee benefits for the members of the Executive Board comprise a fixed component (gross salary and compensation in kind) as well as a variable component (bonuses).\n\nThe amounts reported under post-employment benefits represent the contributions by IMMOFINANZ to a pension fund. These contributions result from defined contribution pension commitments to the members of the Executive Board, which were outsourced to a pension fund.\n\nThe Supervisory Board remuneration reported under short-term benefits reflects the expenses for the respective financial year. However, this remuneration is only paid out after the approval of the annual general meeting which decides on the release from liability of the Supervisory Board members. The members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board held a total of 300 shares as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 150 shares).\n\nNo advances or loans were granted to the members of the Executive Board or Supervisory Board. Moreover, there is no share-based payment for the Executive Board.\n\n## 7.5 Auditor's fees\n\nThe fees charged by Ernst & Young Österreich for services provided in 2023 comprise TEUR 670.3 (2022: Deloitte Österreich TEUR 440.7) for the audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements, TEUR 11.0 (2022: Deloitte Österreich TEUR 95.3) for other consulting services, TEUR 14.0 (2022: Deloitte Österreich TEUR 0.0) for tax advising and TEUR 20.7 (2022: Deloitte Österreich TEUR 0.0) for miscellaneous services.\n\n{236}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 7.6 Subsequent events\n\nThe Management Board of S IMMO AG approved the start of a share buyback programme on 9 January 2023 in accordance with § 65 (1) no. 8 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act. The buyback programme has a volume of up to 365,340 shares (which represent approximately 0.5% of the current share capital of S IMMO AG). The company currently holds 3,266,537 treasury shares (which represent approximately 4.44% of the current share capital of S IMMO AG). The programme started on 15 January 2024 and is expected to end on 31 March 2024.\n\nIMMOFINANZ successfully closed the sale of the Grand Center Zagreb office building to a Croatian real estate company on 8 February and sold two office properties on Dresdnerstrasse in Vienna's 20th district as of 15 March. On 21 March, S IMMO AG signed the contract for the sale of the Zagrebtower. The involved properties had a combined carrying amount of EUR 106.5 million as of 31 December 2023. These transactions represent a further step in the portfolio optimisation.\n\nS IMMO AG signed a non-binding letter of intent with Czech Property Investments, a.s. (CPI AS), a subsidiary of CPI Property Group S.A., on 27 February for the acquisition of a real estate portfolio in the Czech Republic. The portfolio consists of office and retail properties with roughly 134,600 sqm of rentable space and a net asset value of EUR 494.5 million. The annual rental income amounts to approximately EUR 28 million.\n\n{237}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-237-0\"></span>8.

Release of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThese consolidated financial statements were completed and signed by the Executive Board of IMMOFINANZ AG on 27 March 2024 and subsequently distributed to the Supervisory Board.

Those standards require that we comply with International Standards on Auditing (ISA). Our responsibilities under those regulations and standards are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\" section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Austrian General Accepted Accounting Principles and professional requirements and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained until the date of this auditor's report is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion by this date.\n\n#### Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the fiscal year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nThe following are the key audit matters that we identified:\n\n{245}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Valuation of Investment Property\n\n*Risk* \n\nIMMOFINANZ AG reports investment properties in the amount of EUR 7,830.7 mio in its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023. Moreover, the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 report a negative revaluation result from standing investments and goodwill amounting to EUR – 352.2 mio.\n\nInvestment properties are measured based on valuation reports from external, independent valuation experts according to IAS 40 in connection with IFRS 13 at fair value.\n\nThe valuation of investment properties is subject to material assumptions and estimates. The material risk for every individual property exists when determining these assumptions and estimates such as the discount/capitalization rate and rental income. A minor change in these assumptions and estimates can have a material impact on the valuation of investment properties.\n\nThe respective disclosures relating to accounting policies and significant judgements, assumptions and estimates are shown in Section \"4.1 Investment property\" as well as \"5.8 Revaluation results from investment property and goodwill\" in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### *Consideration in the audit*\n\nTo address this risk, we have critically assessed the assumptions and estimates made by management and the external valuation experts and performed, among others, the following audit procedures with involvement of our internal property valuation experts:\n\n- Assessment of concept and design of the underlying property valuation process\n- Assessment of design and effectiveness of relevant key controls in the underlying process based on a sample\n- Assessment of the competence, capability and objectivity of the external valuation experts engaged by management\n- For selected property valuation reports: Assessment of the applied methods, assessment of the reasonableness of the underlying assumptions and estimates (eg. rental income, discount/capitalization rate, usable space, vacancy rate) by means of comparison with market data as well as comparison whether the fair values as per property valuation reports are withing our own developed range of fair values\n- Check of certain input-data as included in the valuation reports with data in the accounting system or underlying agreements\n- Assessment of the adequacy and completeness of the disclosures made in the consolidated financial statements by the management\n\n## Accounting for and valuation of acquisitions of real estate entities from related parties\n\n*Risk* \n\nIn the business year 2023, IMMOFINANZ AG acquired real estate entities from CPI Property Group. CPI Property Group is a related party in the meaning of IAS 24.\n\nThe purchase prices of the acquired real estate entities are based on property values determined by external valuation experts. To evaluate whether the contractual arrangements of the acquisitions are at arm's length, IMMOFINANZ AG engaged an additional independent external expert.\n\nRecognition and measurement of these acquisitions require the application of complex accounting rules, in particular the assessment of whether the transaction constitutes the acquisition of a business under IFRS 3 or is to be recognized as an acquisition of assets. The real estate values on which the purchase prices are based, are subject to material assumptions and estimates.\n\nThere is a risk that acquisitions are not accounted for according to the applicable accounting rules. In addition, the property values determined on which the purchase prices are based could be derived from inappropriate valuation assumptions and therefore lead to purchase prices that are not at arm's length.\n\n{246}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe respective disclosures relating to accounting policies and significant judgements, assumptions and estimates are shown in Section \"2.3 Acquisition of subsidiaries\" and \"7.4 Transactions with related parties\" in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### *Consideration in the audit*\n\nTo address this risk, we have critically assessed the assumptions and estimates made by management and the external valuation experts and performed, among others, the following audit procedures:\n\n- Analysis of the relevant contracts and documents to gain an understanding of the framework and conditions and assessment whether the transactions were recorded in accordance with the applicable accounting rules.\n- Assessment of the competence, capability and objectivity of the external experts engaged by management\n- Analysis and assessment of the external experts' assessment whether the acquisitions are at arm' length\n- Critical assessment of the change in property values between acquisition date and date of the consolidated financial statements\n- Assessment of the adequacy and completeness of the disclosures made in the consolidated financial statements by the management\n\n#### Other matter\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of IMMOFINANZ AG for the year ended December 31, 2022 were audited by another group auditor who expressed an unmodified opinion on those consolidated statements on March 24, 2023.\n\n#### Other Information\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report and the annual financial report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the Group's management report and the auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, to consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n#### Responsibilities of Management and the Audit Committee for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements under Section 245a Austrian Company Code UGB for them to present a true and fair view of the assets, the financial position and the financial performance of the Group and for such internal controls as management determines are necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.\n\n{247}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the EU regulation and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISA, always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the EU regulation and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISA, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.\n\n#### We also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n{248}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n## Comments on the Management Report for the Group\n\nPursuant to Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the management report for the Group is to be audited as to whether it is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and as to whether the management report for the Group was prepared in accordance with the applicable legal regulations.\n\nRegarding the consolidated non-financial statement contained in the group management report, it is our responsibility to examine whether it has been prepared, to read it and to evaluate whether it is, based on our knowledge obtained in the audit, materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the management report for the Group in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing for the audit of the management report for the Group.\n\n#### Opinion\n\nIn our opinion, the management report for the Group was prepared in accordance with the valid legal requirements, comprising the details in accordance with Section 243a Austrian Company Code UGB, and is consistent with the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### Statement\n\nBased on the findings during the audit of the consolidated financial statements and due to the thus obtained understanding concerning the Group and its circumstances no material misstatements in the management report for the Group came to our attention.\n\n{249}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Additional information in accordance with article 10 EU regulation\n\nWe were elected as auditor by the ordinary general meeting at May 3, 2023. We were appointed by the Supervisory Board on July 14, 2023. We are auditors since the financial year 2023.\n\nWe confirm that the audit opinion in the Section \"Report on the consolidated financial statements\" is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee referred to in article 11 of the EU regulation.\n\nWe declare that no prohibited non-audit services (article 5 par. 1 of the EU regulation) were provided by us and that we remained independent of the audited company in conducting the audit.\n\n{250}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Responsible Austrian Certified Public Accountant\n\nThe engagement partner is Alexander Wlasto, Certified Public Accountant.\n\nVienna, 27 March 2024\n\nErnst & Young\n\nWirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H.\n\nAlexander Wlasto mp Isabelle Vollmer mp\n\nWirtschaftsprüfer / Certified Public Accountant Wirtschaftsprüferin / Certified Public Accountant\n\nThis report is a translation of the original report in German, which is solely valid.

General Information\n\nThe annual financial statements of IMMOFINANZ AG (the company) as of 31 December 2023 were prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Austrian Commercial Code (\"Unternehmensgesetzbuch\") in the current version. The principles of correct accounting as well as the general objective of providing a true and fair view of the asset, financial and earnings position were observed.\n\nThis report covers the financial year of IMMOFINANZ AG from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023.\n\nStatements on IMMOFINANZ refer to IMMOFINANZ Group. This company is the parent company, as defined in § 189a no. 6 of the Austrian Commercial Code, of IMMOFINANZ Group. CPI Property Group (CPIPG), which is headquartered in Luxembourg, is the parent company which prepares consolidated financial statements for the largest circle of companies. CPIPG has been the majority shareholder of IMMOFINANZ since May 2022.\n\nIn accordance with § 223 (2) of the Austrian Commercial Code, the comparative prior year data are presented in EUR 1,000.\n\nThe company elected to utilise the option provided by § 223 (4) of the Austrian Commercial Code, which permits the inclusion of additional line items when their content is not covered by a required position\n\nThe income statement was prepared in accordance with the nature of expense method under which \"total costs\" are shown.\n\nThe principle of completeness was followed in preparing the annual financial statements.\n\nAssets and liabilities were valued individually, whereby valuation was based on the going concern principle.\n\nThe principle of prudence was followed, above all, through the recognition of only those profits realised as of the balance sheet date. The annual financial statements include all identifiable risks and impending losses which had arisen as of the balance sheet date.\n\nEstimates are based on prudent judgment. Experience-based statistics from similar transactions were included in these estimates where available.\n\n## 2. Accounting and Valuation Principles\n\nAll intangible assets were purchased for financial consideration. These assets are carried at acquisition cost, less scheduled straight-line amortisation that is based on the expected useful life of the respective asset. No impairment losses were recognised.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are carried at acquisition cost, less scheduled straight-line depreciation. As in previous years, no impairment losses were required.\n\n{257}------------------------------------------------\n\nDepreciation and amortisation for the various asset additions and disposals in the reporting year are calculated beginning with the month of acquisition, respectively terminated in the month of disposal.\n\nLow-value assets are written off in full in the year of purchase or production in accordance with § 204 (1a) of the Austrian Commercial Code.\n\nFinancial assets are carried at cost, less any necessary impairment losses. The impairment testing of shares in subsidiaries, loans granted to subsidiaries, and investments in other companies involves comparing the respective carrying amount with the equity owned plus any undisclosed reserves in the individual properties (after the deduction of deferred taxes) at fair value. Each subsidiary is valued individually and, therefore, the valuation also reflects the total reported by the Group parent company, IMMOFINANZ AG. Investments in other companies are carried at cost, less any necessary impairment losses.\n\nWrite-ups are recognised to financial assets when the reasons for an impairment loss cease to exist.\n\nReceivables are carried at their nominal amount less any necessary impairment losses. The calculation of impairment losses to Group receivables is based on the fair value of equity in the financed company, similar to the valuation of the shares in subsidiaries. If the financial statements of a borrower show negative equity (at fair value), an appropriate impairment loss is recognised.\n\nNegative interest is reported on a separate line under \"other interest and similar income\".\n\nLiabilities are carried at their settlement amount.\n\nTax provisions are recognised, in particular, for obligations arising from the group tax agreement and represent the nominal amount.\n\nAll foreign currency transactions are translated at the average exchange rate in effect on the transaction date. The measurement of foreign currency receivables and liabilities as of the balance sheet date is based on the applicable average exchange rate in effect on that date in keeping with the principle of conservatism. Any resulting exchange rate losses are recognised to profit or loss in the applicable financial year.\n\nIn accordance with § 198 (9) and (10) of the Austrian Commercial Code, deferred taxes are recognised in agreement with the balance sheet-oriented concept and without discounting at the current corporate tax rate of 23%. A net amount based on the total difference method is calculated for the differences between the carrying amounts of assets, provisions, liabilities, prepaid expenses and deferred charges and deferred income under commercial law and tax law, in cases where these differences are expected to decrease in later financial years or lead to tax relief in the future. Deferred tax assets are also recognised for existing tax loss carryforwards at an amount equal to the available deferred tax liabilities, in accordance with the 75% limit on the utilisation of losses. Current forecasts provide sufficient substantial indications of future taxable gains, and the option for the recognition of additional loss carryforwards was therefore exercised as of 31 December 2023.\n\n{258}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 3. Notes to the Balance Sheet\n\n### Assets\n\n#### Non-current assets\n\nThe development of non-current assets is shown on the attached schedule.\n\nThe following useful lives are used to calculate scheduled straight-line depreciation and amortisation for noncurrent assets:\n\n|                               | Useful life in years |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Intangible assets             | 3–10                 |\n| Property, plant and equipment | 2–10                 |\n\nThe following section provides information on the shares in subsidiaries and investments in other companies:\n\nThe most important items included under shares in subsidiaries represent the shares in IMBEA IMMOEAST Beteiligungsverwaltung GmbH with a carrying amount of EUR 1,214,355,093.00 (31 December 2022: TEUR 1,773,388).\n\nIn 2023, SC Czech AGL s.r.o. received a contribution of EUR 77.6 million (2022: IMMOFINANZ Services Czech Republic s.r.o. EUR 133.3 million).\n\nThe impairment losses recognised to shares in subsidiaries amounted to EUR 671.7 million and resulted primarily from a write-down of EUR 108.1 million to the wholly owned subsidiary IMMOWEST Immobilien Anlagen GmbH and a distribution-based write-down of EUR 559.0 million to the wholly owned subsidiary IMBEA IMMOEAST Beteiligungsverwaltung GmbH (2022: impairment losses of EUR 118.5 million; related chiefly to IMMOWEST Immobilien Anlagen GmbH at EUR 70.7 million and to IMBEA IMMOEAST Beteiligungsverwaltung GmbH at EUR 47.8 million).\n\nThe most important item under loans granted to subsidiaries is the loan to Warsaw Spire Tower Sp.z.o.o. with a carrying amount of EUR 102,022,549.15 (31 December 2022: TEUR 100,149). The additions and reductions to loans granted to subsidiaries consist primarily of drawdowns and repayments during the 2023 financial year. Of the total loans granted to subsidiaries, EUR 0.00 (31 December 2022: TEUR 0) is due within one year.\n\nIMMOFINANZ AG purchased 19,499,437 bearer shares of S IMMO AG (in short: S IMMO) on 18 April 2018 and, as a result of this transaction, held an investment of approximately 29.14% in this company. The closing took place on 21 September 2018. The acquisition costs, including ancillary expenses, totalled EUR 390.7 million. A capital increase by S IMMO AG reduced this holding to approximately 26.5%.\n\nIMMOFINANZ AG acquired 17,305,012 shares in S IMMO from its core shareholder, CPI Property Group on 27 December 2022 and, in doing so, raised its holding to a majority investment of 50% plus one share in S IMMO. The acquisition costs, including ancillary expenses, totalled EUR 338.0 million (i.e. EUR 19.5 per S IMMO share). This transaction resulted in the reclassification from investments in other companies to shares in subsidiaries during 2022. The carrying amount of the investment in S IMMO equalled EUR 728.6 million as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 728.6 million).\n\nNon-current securities include shares in the Vienna Stock Exchange corporation with a value of EUR 1,000,699.26 (31 December 2022: TEUR 1,001).\n\nOther originated loans include EUR 145,000.00 (31 December 2022: TEUR 650) which are due within one year.\n\n{259}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Current assets\n\n#### Receivables\n\nReceivables from subsidiaries are classified as current when a specific payment term was not defined.

IMMOFINANZ AG serves as the lead company of this group. The lead company and the members of the tax group concluded an agreement for the settlement of taxes, which was amended in 2011/12. In accordance with the amended agreement, each member with positive results must pay a tax charge to the lead company. The charge equals 24% of the assessment base and is based on the tax rate defined in § 22 (1) of the Austrian Corporate Income Tax Act. Any losses by the group members are registered and can be offset in full against taxable profit recorded by the respective member in subsequent years. Group members with registered tax losses are not required to make payments to the lead company; no payments for (negative) charges are made by the lead company to the group members.\n\nS IMMO Group also had a corporate tax group pursuant to § 9 of the Austrian Corporate Income Tax Act with S IMMO AG as the lead company of this group. This tax group was integrated in the IMMOFINANZ tax group during 2023. Based on the tax assessment agreement concluded between the IMMOFINANZ AG and S IMMO companies, S IMMO AG with its subsidiaries forms a separate accounting entity for the tax charge. If S IMMO AG generates positive results, it is required to pay a (positive) tax charge to the head of the group equal to 20% of the assessment base. The generation of positive results by the S IMMO group members results in the payment of a (positive) tax charge to S IMMO AG equal to 24% of the assessment base. Losses incurred by the tax subgroup, respectively by the S IMMO group members are registered and can be offset in full against taxable profit recorded by the respective tax subgroup or S IMMO group member in subsequent years. Payments by S IMMO AG to the lead company or by an S IMMO group member to S IMMO AG are not required when registered losses are utilised. No payments for (negative) charges are made by the lead company to S IMMO AG or by S IMMO AG to the S IMMO group members.\n\n{265}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Related party transactions as defined in § 238 no. 12 of the Austrian Commercial Code\n\nThe market conformity of transactions with related parties and persons is documented and regularly monitored.\n\n## Minimum taxation in the sense of § 238 no. 3a of the Austrian Commercial Code\n\nIn December 2022, the member states of the European Union approved an EU directive on the implementation of a global minimum tax for multinational enterprise groups and large-scale domestic groups in the Union (EU Directive No. 2022/2523 from 14 December 2022). The guideline required implementation by the EU member states into national law by 31 December 2023 with enactment as of 1 January 2024. The directive calls for an additional tax on profits that are taxed at an effective tax rate of less than 15%.\n\nThis EU directive was implemented in Austria as of 1 January 2024 through the Minimum Tax Reform Act, Federal Gazette No. 187/2023 (\"Mindestbesteuerungsreformgesetz BGBl 187/2023\").\n\nThe takeover of IMMOFINANZ AG and S IMMO AG by CPI Property Group S.A. in 2022 resulted in total revenues that exceeded the threshold of EUR 750 million. IMMOFINANZ AG and the IMMOFINANZ Group companies are subject to the provisions of the Minimum Tax Reform Act. CPI Property Group S.A. is the ultimate parent company of IMMOFINANZ AG and the IMMOFINANZ Group companies.\n\nHowever, IMMOFINANZ AG is classified as a parent company in part ownership because over 20% of its shares are held by parties outside the Group. IMMOFINANZ AG is therefore subject to the provisions of the Minimum Tax Reform Act on the low-taxed business units under its control and is required to pay a minimum tax in Austria.\n\nAll major countries (with the exception of Poland) where IMMOFINANZ Group is active have enacted national tax regulations for minimum taxation in accordance with the EU directive which took effect at the end of 2022. These countries have implemented the regulations through a national top-up tax that takes effect as of 1 January 2024. It is expected that top-up tax will be chargeable to the IMMOFINANZ Group companies in Hungary (9%), Cyprus (12.5%), Croatia (10%, resp. 18%), Poland (9%, resp. 19%) and Bulgaria (10%) because the applicable nominal tax rates in these countries are currently below 15%. It is also expected that, in the end, a national top-up tax will be introduced in all countries.\n\nIMMOFINANZ AG can require compensation from the other business units for the minimum tax it pays in line with the regulations defined by company law but no compensatory agreements have been concluded to date.\n\nThe quantitative effects from the application of the Minimum Tax Reform Act are currently under evaluation. Due to the complexity of the analyses and the fact that the necessary reporting processes must still be developed, the effects cannot be reliably estimated at the present time.\n\nIn accordance with § 198 (10) sentence 3 no. 4 of the Austrian Commercial Code, deferred taxes arising from the application of the Minimum Tax Reform Act or a comparable foreign law were not recognised in 2023. No current taxes from the minimum taxation regulations were recognised as of 31 December 2023 in the absence of application.\n\nIMMOFINANZ AG held tax loss carryforwards totalling EUR 2,685,324,944.00 as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: TEUR 2,890,764).\n\nIMMOFINANZ AG also held deductible temporary partial depreciation charges on investments (\"Siebentelabschreibung\") totalling EUR

|\n\n{272}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Non-financial performance indicators / environmental issues\n\nIMMOFINANZ is committed to the responsible use of natural resources, the use of climate-friendly technologies, a systematic energy savings strategy, the refurbishment of building substance which is worth preserving and the construction of efficient new buildings. This reduces operating costs and emissions and also contributes to environmental protection and tenant satisfaction.\n\nCorporate goals include the steady reduction of energy consumption as well as an increase in the energy efficiency of the standing investment portfolio and the related energy savings. The environmental impact is estimated prior to the start of new activities or projects, and the results of these analyses are integrated in the decision process. Plans also include the gradual expansion of sustainability certification for development projects and standing investments. These certifications reduce environmental risks and help to improve the environmentally friendly use of space and achieve an increase in efficiency.\n\n### D. Information on Equity\n\nThe share capital of IMMOFINANZ equalled EUR 138,669,711.00 as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 138,669,711.00) and was divided into 138,669,711 zero par value shares with voting rights, each of which represented a proportional share of EUR 1.00 in share capital.\n\n### Treasury Shares\n\n#### Treasury shares held\n\nIMMOFINANZ held 695,585 treasury shares with a proportional share of EUR 695,585.00 in share capital as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 695,585 treasury shares with a proportional share of EUR 695,585.00 in share capital). These treasury shares represented approximately 0.5% of share capital.\n\nNo treasury shares were purchased or sold during the 2023 financial year.\n\n#### Authorisations of the annual general meeting to purchase and sell treasury shares\n\nThe annual general meeting on 3 May 2023 authorised the Executive Board, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to repurchase the company's shares in accordance with § 65 (1) no. 8 and (1a) and (1b) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act at an amount equalling up to 10% of share capital during a period of 30 months. The shares may be purchased over the stock exchange or over the counter. The Executive Board was also authorised, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the proportional subscription rights of shareholders.\n\nThe Executive Board was also authorised, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to sell or use treasury shares in another manner than over the stock exchange or through a public offering in accordance with § 65 (1b) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act during a period of five years, whereby the proportional subscription rights of shareholders can be excluded.\n\nThe authorisation for the purchase and sale of treasury shares has not been used to date and is therefore available in full.\n\n## Authorised capital\n\nThe annual general meeting on 3 May 2023 authorised the Executive Board, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, pursuant to § 169 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act to increase the company's share capital by up to EUR 69,334,855.00 through the issue of up to 69,334,855 new shares in exchange for cash or contributions in kind. The authorisation is valid up to 21 July 2028. The Executive Board is also authorised, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the subscription rights of shareholders in full or in part. The \n\n{273}------------------------------------------------\n\nshares issued based on this authorisation in exchange for cash contributions and under the exclusion of shareholders' subscription rights may not exceed EUR 13,866,971.00, which represents roughly 10% of the company's share capital at the time the resolution was passed by the annual general meeting.\n\nThis authorisation to increase share capital has not been used to date and is therefore available in full.\n\n## Convertible bonds and conditional capital\n\nThe annual general meeting on 3 May 2023 authorised the Executive Board, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, pursuant to § 174 (2) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act to issue convertible bonds up to a total nominal value of EUR 618,092,498.00 which are connected with exchange and/or subscription rights for up to 69,334,855 bearer shares of the company with a proportional share of EUR 69,334,855.00 in share capital. These convertible bonds may be issued in multiple tranches and within a period of five years. Moreover, the Executive Board was authorised to determine all other conditions as well as the issue and exchange procedures for the convertible bonds. The convertible bonds can be issued in exchange for cash or contributions in kind. The subscription rights of shareholders are excluded.\n\nShare capital was conditionally increased, pursuant to § 159 (2) no. 1 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act, by up to EUR 69,334,855.00 through the issue of up to 69,334,855 new bearer shares. The purpose of this conditional capital increase is the issue of shares to the holders of the convertible bonds which were issued in accordance with a resolution of the annual general meeting on 3 May 2023.\n\nThe authorisation for the issue of convertible bonds has not been used to date and is therefore available in full.\n\n## Change of control provisions\n\n#### Corporate bond 2020–2027\n\nThe terms and conditions of the corporate bond 2020–2027 (XS2243564478) issued in October 2020 entitle the bondholders to terminate their bonds and demand immediate repayment at 101% of the nominal value plus accrued interest as of the respective date when a controlling investment (also taking into account the reduced threshold defined by the articles of association) in the company, as defined in the Austrian Takeover Act, is acquired and results in a mandatory takeover offer. Details on these provisions are provided in the issue terms of the bonds.\n\n#### Property financing\n\nThe material property financing agreements concluded by IMMOFINANZ and its subsidiaries generally include standard market cancellation rights for the lenders in the event of a change of control.\n\n#### Corporate credit line\n\nIMMOFINANZ concluded an unsecured, revolving corporate credit line of EUR 100.0 million. It includes a termination right in the event of a change of control. As of 31 December 2023, the corporate credit line had not been used and is therefore available in full.\n\n#### Bonds issued by S IMMO AG\n\nS IMMO is included through full consolidation based on the investment of 50% plus one share held by IMMOFINANZ (for information on full consolidation, also see section 2.3 in the consolidated financial statements). Following is a listing of the bonds issued by S IMMO which include change-of-control clauses that take effect in connection with an indirect change of control at the IMMOFINANZ level.\n\nThe following bonds issued by S IMMO include change-of-control provisions: the 3.25% S IMMO Bond 2015–2025 issued in April 2015 (volume as of 31 December 2023: EUR 15,890,000.00), the 3.25% S IMMO Bond 2015–2027 issued in April 2015 (volume as of 31 December 2023: EUR 34,199,000.00), the 1.75% S IMMO Bond 2018–2024 (volume as of 31 December 2023: EUR 100,000,000.00) and the 2.875% S IMMO Bond 2018–2030 both issued in February 2018 (volume as of 31 December 2023: \n\n{274}------------------------------------------------\n\nEUR 50,000,000.00), the 1.875% S IMMO Bond 2019–2026 issued in May 2019 (volume as of 31 December 2023: EUR 150,000,000.00), the 2.0% S IMMO Bond 2019–2029 issued in October 2019 (volume as of 31 December 2023: EUR 100,000,000.00), the 1.75% S IMMO Green Bond 2021–2028 issued in February 2021 (volume as of 31 December 2023: EUR 70,449,500.00), the 1.25% S IMMO Green Bond 2022–2027 issued in January 2022 (volume as of 31 December 2023: EUR 25,058,500.00), and the 5.5% S IMMO Green Bond 2023–2028 issued in July 2023 (volume as of 31 December 2023: EUR 75,000,000.00). The terms and conditions of the bonds issued in 2014 and 2015 and the green bonds issued in 2021, 2022 and 2023 entitle the bondholders, in the event of a change of control, to put their bonds and demand immediate repayment. The terms and conditions of the bonds issued in 2018 and 2019 entitle the bondholders, in the event of a change of control, to put their bonds if the change of control materially impairs the ability of S IMMO to meet its obligations under the bond. A change of control as defined in the bond terms and conditions occurs when one or more persons acting in consort, or a third party or persons acting for such person or persons, at any time, directly or indirectly (i) hold(s) more than 50% of the voting rights connected with the issuer's shares (excluding the maximum voting right) or (ii) has(have) the right to determine the majority of the issuer's management board members and/or shareholder representatives on the issuer's supervisory board. According to the terms and conditions of the bonds issued in 2019, a change of control is also assumed to take place when the maximum voting right is legally cancelled and one or more persons acting in consort, or a third party or persons acting for such person or persons, at any time, directly or indirectly, has(have) purchased more than 30% of the voting rights connected with the issuer's shares. According to the terms and conditions of the green bonds issued in 2021, 2022 and 2023, a change of control is also assumed to take place when one or more persons acting in consort, or a third party or persons acting for such person or persons, at any time, directly or indirectly, acquire(s) a controlling interest as defined in the Austrian Takeover Act which triggers a mandatory takeover offer.\n\n#### Executive Board und Supervisory Board\n\nThe Executive Board contracts with Radka Doehring and Pavel Měchura do not include a change-of-control clause.\n\nThere are no such agreements for the members of the Supervisory Board or for employees.\n\nThe company has no other significant agreements which would enter into force, change or terminate in the event of a change of control that results from a takeover bid.\n\n### Amendments to the articles of association, board appointments and dismissals\n\nIn accordance with § 21 of the articles of association, the annual general meeting passes its resolutions based on a simple majority of the votes cast and, for resolutions that require a majority of capital, based on a simple majority of the share capital represented at the time of voting, unless legal regulations require a different majority. The same applies to amendments to the articles of association and to the premature dismissal of members from the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe person chairing the respective meeting casts the deciding vote in the event of a tie in voting on the Supervisory Board in accordance with the articles of association. This also applies to the election to and dismissal of members from the Executive Board.\n\nThe corporate governance report included in this annual report, which was expanded to include the consolidated corporate governance report, is available on the company's website under https://immofinanz.com.\n\n{275}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Significant holdings\n\nInformation reported to the company, directors' dealings notifications and other disclosures show the following investments and attributed voting rights which exceeded 4% of share capital as of 31 December 2023:\n\n- Radovan Vitek (via CPI Property Group S.A.): over 75% (based on a notification dated 21 December 2023 and a Directors' Dealings report from 22 December 2023)\n- Klaus Umek (via Petrus Advisers Investments Fund L.P.): 5.46% (1.06% in shares and 4.40% in financial/other instruments; based on a notification dated 22 December 2023)\n\n## E. Research and Development\n\nTechnological and social transformation as well as the fight against climate change have an influence on the real estate sector. In order to be optimally positioned to also offer efficient and profitably manageable property solutions in the future, IMMOFINANZ Group monitors the changes in work processes as well as the influence of environmental factors and tenants' demands on space and building concepts. The focus on training and continuing education has been increased to support internal innovation strength and sustainability efforts. IMMOFINANZ Group also maintains regular contacts with other companies and organisations and is a member of numerous associations and institutions like IG Lebenszyklus, the Austrian Council of Shopping Places and the Green Building Council. Apart from these diverse activities, IMMOFINANZ Group did not invest any funds in 2023 that could be classified as conventional research and development. This type of information is therefore not provided.\n\n## F. Branch Offices\n\nIMMOFINANZ AG has no branch offices.\n\n## G. Financial Instruments and Risk Reporting\n\nAs an international real estate investor, property owner and project developer, IMMOFINANZ is exposed to a variety of general and branch-specific risks in its business operations. An integrated risk management process provides the Group with a sound basis for the timely identification of potential risks and the assessment of the potential consequences.\n\nRisks represent the possibility of deviating from planned targets as the result of \"coincidental\" disruptions caused by the unpredictable nature of the future. In this connection, negative variances are considered risks in the strict sense of the term and positive variances are seen as opportunities.\n\n## Principles of integrated risk management\n\nThe structure of risk management is based on the rules of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code and the integrated framework of the COSO ERM\\*, an internationally recognised concept for the design of risk management systems.\n\nBased on the hedging and management instruments currently in use, no material risks can be identified at the present time that would endanger the company's standing as a going concern. The overall risk situation for IMMOFINANZ and for the entire market in 2023 was influenced by the challenging political and macroeconomic environment. The major risk categories are discussed in greater detail at the end of this risk report.\n\n{276}------------------------------------------------\n\nIMMOFINANZ has anchored the procedures for handling risk in a Group-wide risk management system, which is integrated in business practices and reporting paths and has a direct influence on processes and strategic decisions. Risk management takes place at all levels through internal guidelines, reporting systems and the internal control system (ICS) which is monitored by the internal audit department.\n\n#### Monitoring and control of the risk management system\n\nThe risk management system is monitored and controlled through two corporate channels. On the one hand, internal audit evaluates the effectiveness of risk management and contributes to its improvement. On the other hand, the auditor reviews the functionality of risk management in accordance with C-Rule 83 of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code (in the version released in January 2023) and reports to the Executive Board on the results of this analysis.\n\n#### Evaluation of the functionality of the risk management system\n\nErnst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H., Vienna, evaluated the effectiveness of IMMOFINANZ's risk management system during the period from December 2023 to February 2024. This analysis covered the design and implementation of the measures and organisational procedures instituted by the company, but not their application in the sense of operating effectiveness. The conclusions by Ernst & Young indicated that the risk management system instituted by IMMOFINANZ as of 31 December 2023 – based on the COSO comprehensive framework for corporate risk management – is functional.\n\n### Structure of risk management\n\nThe goal of risk management is to implement the strategy defined by the Executive Board with a minimum of risk. The Group's strategic goals are transferred to the operating processes where the measures for the identification, prevention and management of risks are located.\n\nImage /page/276/Figure/8 description: The image shows an organizational chart titled \"Responsibilities and reporting paths\". The chart shows a hierarchy with the \"Supervisory Board\" at the top, followed by the \"Executive Board\". Below the \"Executive Board\" are two boxes, one labeled \"Department heads/Country management\" and the other labeled \"Risk management\". Both of these boxes have \"Employees\" listed below them.\n\n{277}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Executive Board is responsible for risk management in IMMOFINANZ Group and defines the corporate goals and related risk strategy.\n\nRisk management is a staff function which reports directly to the Executive Board. It monitors the corporate risks that are not related to specific business areas, aggregates risk data and reports, and actively supports the business areas and country organisations in the identification of risks and economically feasible countermeasures. Risk management reports regularly to the Executive Board and quarterly to the Supervisory Board.\n\nAt the country organisation level, the heads of the respective units are responsible for risk management. Risk positions are reported to the Executive Board at least once each quarter by the business area and country managers. Acute risks are reported immediately to the Executive Board.\n\n#### Risk management process\n\nImage /page/277/Figure/5 description: The image shows a flowchart of risk management steps. The first step is \"Risk identification\", followed by \"Risk assessment\", then \"Risk management\", and finally \"Risk controlling\". Each step has a brief description associated with it.

IMMOFINANZ has defined a broad range of measures to address and counter risks. These measures represent an integral part of all corporate processes and, consequently, form the basis for the reduction of risk.\n\n| Risk category                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Countermeasures                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Business risks                       | These risks are related to the general framework condi-<br>tions for business activities and exceed the scope of<br>property-specific risks.                                                                                                                | These risks are countered by strategic decisions at the<br>corporate level.                                                                                                                                                      |\n|                                      | Financial risks are related to lenders or the terms and<br>conditions for the provision of cash and cash equiva<br>lents (see section 7.2 in the consolidated financial<br>statements).                                                                     | The continuous monitoring of asset and liability posi-<br>tions as well as proactive analyses form the basis for<br>strategic measures to safeguard the company's financial<br>strength.                                         |\n|                                      | Operational risk can arise through detrimental actions<br>by corporate bodies and/or employees to the disad-<br>vantage of the company.                                                                                                                     | The company's activities are separated into individual<br>processes and relevant process steps are controlled in-<br>ternally.                                                                                                   |\n|                                      | Other risks represent individual risks with a Group-wide<br>impact.                                                                                                                                                                                         | These risks are countered by strategic decisions at the<br>corporate level.                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Risks of improper business practices | IMMOFINANZ is committed to responsible and trans-<br>parent actions and to compliance with legal rules and<br>regulations.

An unsecured, revolving corporate credit line of EUR 100.0 million is also available. Roughly 95% of our financial liabilities are hedged against rising interest rates, and our goal is to continue this conservative financial policy. Gearing, based on the net LTV, should therefore remain at a conservative level over the medium term.\n\nOur focus in the current market environment lies primarily on long-term bank financing. For new financing as well as refinancing at the property level, we benefit from long-term, cooperative relationships with banks in our core markets. After the successful refinancing of approximately EUR 1 billion of bank liabilities in 2023, we are currently meeting with our financing banks to discuss the premature extension of expiring financing at the current market conditions.\n\nMost experts anticipate a reduction in key eurozone interest rates by the European Central Bank (ECB) in 2024. These prospects have recently led to a more optimistic mood in the real estate sector. Transactions could therefore increase during the second half of 2024 in a more attractive climate based on lower interest rates and stabilised yields.\n\n{284}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Close cooperation with CPIPG and S IMMO\n\nWork on the integration of IMMOFINANZ and S IMMO started in 2022. Under the direction of the CPI Property Group CPIPG), we bundled resources in asset and property management and in other service areas to optimise our organisational structures and significantly improve efficiency. These activities successfully continued with the signing of a framework agreement with S IMMO to evaluate further integration options. We have already realised synergies, including common service contracts and the standardisation of IT systems and processes. CPI Property Group, as the core shareholder of IMMOFINANZ, is actively supporting this process with an aim towards the identification and realisation of further synergies. In spite of this progress, our tenants remain our first priority. We intend to continue offering optimal property solutions in the future to further strengthen our leading position in the branch.\n\nThis outlook reflects the Executive Board's assessments as of 27 March 2024 and includes statements and forecasts concerning the future development of IMMOFINANZ Group. The forecasts represent estimates that are based on the information available at the present time. If the underlying assumptions do not occur or risks – as indicated in the risk report – materialise, actual results could differ from the statements made here. This annual report does not represent a recommendation to buy or sell IMMOFINANZ AG securities.\n\nSignificant events occurring after the end of the reporting year are discussed in the notes, see section \"Subsequent events\".\n\nVienna, 27 March 2024\n\nThe Executive Board of IMMOFINANZ AG\n\nRadka Doehring Member of the Executive Board\n\n Pavel Měchura Member of the Executive Board\n\n{285}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-285-0\"></span>Auditor's report\n\n## Report on the Financial Statements\n\n#### Audit Opinion\n\nWe have audited the financial statements of IMMOFINANZ AG, Vienna. These financial statements comprise the balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, the income statement for the fiscal year then ended and the notes.´\n\nBased on our audit the accompanying financial statements were prepared in accordance with the legal regulations and present fairly, in all material respects, the assets and the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and its financial performance for the year then ended in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\n\n#### Basis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the regulation (EU) no. 537/2014 (in the following \"EU regulation\") and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with International Standards on Auditing (ISA). Our responsibilities under those regulations and standards are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\" section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Austrian General Accepted Accounting Principles and professional requirements and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained until the date of this auditor's report is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion by this date.\n\n#### Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the fiscal year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nThe following is the key audit matter that we identified:\n\n#### *Titel* Valuation of investments in and loans to subsidiaries as well as receivables from subsidiaries\n\n*Risk* The financial statements of IMMOFINANZ AG as of December 31, 2023 show material investments in subsidiaries (MEUR 3.182,4), loans to subsidiaries (MEUR 227,3) as well as receivables from subsidiaries (MEUR 302,9). Furthermore, the financial statements show impairment losses (MEUR 667,5) in the expenses arising from financial assets and impairment losses in relation to receivables against subsidiaries (MEUR 25,7) in other operating expenses.\n\n> All investments in and loans to subsidiaries as well as receivables from subsidiaries are tested for impairment. These impairment assessments require significant assumptions and estimates.\n\n> Due to the fact that most of the subsidiaries are real estate companies, the impairment test is based on a simplified entity value which is mainly influenced by the property valuation reports by external, independent valuation experts or already contractually agreed purchase prices. The material risk within the valuation reports exists when determining assumptions and estimates such as the discount/capitalization rate and rental income. A minor change in these assumptions and estimates can have a material impact on the valuation of investments in and loans to subsidiaries as well as receivables from subsidiaries.\n\n{286}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe respective disclosures relating to investments in and loans to affiliated companies are shown in Section \"2. Accounting and Valuation Principles\" and in Section \"3. Notes to the Balance Sheet\", the disclosures relating to impairment losses in Section \"4. Notes to the Income Statement\" in the financial statements as of December 31, 2023.\n\n*dit* \n\n*Considera-* To address this risk, we have critically assessed the assumptions and estimates made by *tion in the au-* management and the external valuation experts and performed, among others, the following audit procedures with involvement of our internal property valuation experts:\n\n- Assessment of concept and design of the underlying business process of the valuation of investments in and loans to subsidiaries as well as receivables from subsidiaries\n- Assessment of the applied methods and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations and supporting documentation for the valuation of investments in and loans to subsidiaries as well as receivables from subsidiaries\n- Assessment of design and effectiveness of relevant key controls in the property valuation process based on a sample\n- Assessment of the competence, capability and objectivity of the external valuation experts engaged by management\n- For selected property valuation reports: Assessment of the applied methods, assessment of the reasonableness of the underlying assumptions and estimates (eg. rental income, discount/capitalization rate, usable space, vacancy rate) by means of comparison with market data as well as comparison whether the fair values as per property valuation reports are withing our own developed range of fair values\n- Check of certain input-data as included in the property valuation reports with data in the accounting system or underlying agreements\n- Assessment of the adequacy and completeness of the disclosures made in the financial statements by the management\n\n#### Other matter\n\nThe financial statements of IMMOFINANZ AG for the year ended December 31, 2022, were audited by another auditor who expressed an unmodified opinion on those statements on March 24, 2023.\n\n#### Other Information\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report and the annual financial report, but does not include the financial statements, the management report and the auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, to consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n#### Responsibilities of Management and of the Audit Committee for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, for them to present a true and fair view of the assets, the financial position and the financial performance of the Company and for such internal controls as management determines are necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n{287}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.\n\n#### Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the EU regulation and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISA, always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the EU regulation and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISA, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.\n\nWe also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.

The Executive Board provided the Supervisory Board with extensive, ongoing and timely information on the development of business, the market and financing environment, the developments on the real estate and capital markets and in IMMOFINANZ's core countries as well as the company's asset, financial and earnings position and, in this way, met its information requirements at all times and in appropriate depth.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year ten Supervisory Board meetings were held, with an attendance rate of 93% of the shareholder representatives. In addition, four committee meetings with a total attendance of 94% took place. A detailed overview of the attendance of the individual members and committees can be found in the corporate governance report.\n\nOutside the framework of these meetings, the Supervisory Board remained in regular contact with the Executive Board and adopted a number of decisions through circular resolutions. The cooperation between the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board was consistently characterised by open discussions and constructive teamwork.\n\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board completed a routine annual self-evaluation of its working efficiency, above all with regard to its organisation and operating procedures.\n\n#### Focal points of our work\n\nIn June 2022, we had adopted a strategy update after becoming part of CPI Property Group and made significant progress in its implementation in 2023. Specifically, we are concentrating more than ever on a flexible and innovative property offering with a strong customer focus. A robust financial policy, which targets sufficient liquidity at all times, a balanced capital structure and maturity profile as well as optimising our financing costs, constitutes another cornerstone of this strategy.\n\nWith regard to its portfolio, IMMOFINANZ aims to achieve further optimisation through targeted acquisitions and, in some cases, through development projects, always with a focus on higher-yielding properties. The refurbishment of standing investments, in which we always give special consideration to aspects of sustainability, represents another central focus of our portfolio strategy. Moreover, strategic property sales also form part of our active portfolio management. Here, we are aiming to streamline our standing investments, thus creating the basis for further successful growth.\n\n#### Changes in the Supervisory Board\n\nIn the past financial year, shareholder representative Gayatri Narayan resigned from the IMMOFINANZ Supervisory Board with effect from 31 December 2023, and employee representative Werner Ertelthalner with effect from 3 May 2023, both at their own request.\n\nThe shareholder representatives are thus Martin Němeček (Vice-Chairman), Martin Matula and I in my role as Chairwoman. The Supervisory Board is completed by Philipp Obermair and Anton Weichselbaum on the employee side, with whom we have very good cooperation.\n\nOn behalf of the entire Supervisory Board, I would like to thank the members who resigned from their functions for their professional work and their support of IMMOFINANZ.\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Changes in the Executive Board\n\nWith effect from 16 June 2023, the Supervisory Board appointed Pavel Měchura as a member of the Executive Board. Pavel Měchura is a top-class manager, who has long-standing and comprehensive expertise in the finance and real estate sector as well as in transformation processes and strategic planning. The Executive Board thus consists of Radka Doehring and Pavel Měchura. Radka Doehring's mandate was extended early on 19 July 2023 for a total period of five years, hence until the end of April 2027.\n\n#### Approval of the 2023 annual financial statements\n\nThe following documents were prepared by the Executive Board and audited by Ernst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H., which was appointed as the auditor by the annual general meeting on 3 May 2023: the annual financial statements of IMMOFINANZ AG as of 31 December 2023 including the management report and the consolidated financial statements together with the group management report. All of these documents were awarded an unqualified opinion (see auditor's report in the consolidated financial statements).\n\nThe annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements as well as the related auditor's reports were made available to all Supervisory Board members immediately after their completion. These documents were discussed by the Audit and Valuation Committee in detail in the presence of the auditor and the Executive Board and reviewed in accordance with § 96 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act. Following this examination and discussion, the members of the Audit and Valuation Committee agreed to recommend the unqualified acceptance of these documents to the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board accepted the annual financial statements as of 31 December 2023, which are considered approved in accordance with § 96 (4) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act. The consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2023 were also accepted by the Supervisory Board. In accordance with L-Rule 60 of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code, the Supervisory Board reviewed and approved the expanded corporate governance report, which now also includes the consolidated corporate governance report and the non-financial statement.\n\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board, I would like to thank the Executive Board and all employees of our company for their outstanding performance during the past financial year. IMMOFINANZ's position as a market leader for retail parks in Europe and its pioneering role in flexible office solutions were further expanded despite the difficult economic environment.\n\nI would also like to thank you, our shareholders, for accompanying us on this journey.\n\nVienna, 27 March 2024\n\nMiroslava Greštiaková Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board\n\n{5}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-5-0\"></span>Corporate Governance Report\n\nexpanded to include the Consolidated Corporate Governance Report\n\n## Commitment to the Austrian Corporate Governance Code\n\nIMMOFINANZ pursues responsible business activities that are designed to create and maintain sustainable, long-term value. In line with this orientation, the company strives to achieve a high degree of transparency for all stakeholders. The Austrian Corporate Governance Code<sup>\\*</sup> provides Austrian stock companies with a framework for corporate management and monitoring. The Executive Board and Supervisory Board of IMMOFINANZ AG are committed to compliance with the code, in the currently applicable version, and to the related transparency and principles of good management. IMMOFINANZ complied with all provisions of the code – with the exception of the following temporary deviation – during the 2023 financial year.\n\n#### Deviation from C-Rule 16\n\nC-Rule 16 requires the Executive Board to have several members and a chairperson. Radka Doehring was the sole member of the Executive Board until 16 June 2023. With effect from 16 June 2023, Pavel Měchura was appointed a member of the Executive Board. Hence, the Executive Board now consists of Radka Doehring and Pavel Měchura. The Supervisory Board did not consider it necessary to appoint a CEO.\n\n## Corporate Bodies\n\n### Dual management structure\n\nThe dual management structure of IMMOFINANZ AG, as a listed stock corporation, consists of an Executive Board and a Supervisory Board. These corporate bodies are strictly separated, in both their composition and functions, and can therefore independently carry out their assigned duties. The Executive Board is responsible for the management of the company, the Supervisory Board for monitoring.\n\n{6}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### The Executive Board\n\nImage /page/6/Picture/2 description: A portrait of a woman with shoulder-length dark brown hair and glasses.

In addition to its primary function as a monitoring and support body, the Supervisory Board constantly strives to further improve the efficiency of its work through self-evaluation. At the beginning of the 2023 financial year, the Supervisory Board had four members who were elected by the annual general meeting (shareholder representatives) and two members delegated by the Works Council. Gayatri Narayan resigned from her function with effect from 31 December 2023. Ten Supervisory Board meetings were held in 2023. These meetings were attended by 93% of the shareholder representatives. Including the four individual committee meetings, total attendance was 93%.\n\n{9}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                             | Attendance      |                      |      |                                     |      |                                  |      |                                             |      |                   |                           |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|------|-------------------------------------|------|----------------------------------|------|---------------------------------------------|------|-------------------|---------------------------|\n| Member                                      | Member<br>since | Meetings<br>(Plenum) | in % | Audit and<br>Valuation<br>Committee | in % | Strategy<br>and ESG<br>Committee | in % | Personnel<br>and<br>Nominating<br>Committee | in % | Total<br>presence | Total<br>presence<br>in % |\n| Meetings/year                               |                 | 10                   |      | 4                                   |      |                                  |      |                                             |      | 14                |                           |\n| Miroslava Greštiaková,<br>Chairwoman        | 2022            | 10/10                | 100  | 4/4                                 | 100  |                                  |      |                                             |      | 14                | 100                       |\n| Martin Němeček,<br>Vice-Chairman            | 2022            | 10/10                | 100  | 4/4                                 | 100  |                                  |      |                                             |      | 14                | 100                       |\n| Martin Matula                               | 2022            | 10/10                | 100  | 4/4                                 | 100  |                                  |      |                                             |      | 14                | 100                       |\n| Gayatri Narayan (up to<br>31 December 2023) | 2021            | 7/10                 | 70   | 3/4                                 | 75   |                                  |      |                                             |      | 10                | 71                        |\n| Average meeting<br>attendance               |                 | 37/40                | 93   | 15/16                               | 94   |                                  |      |                                             |      | 52/56             | 93                        |\n\n#### Audit and Valuation Committee\n\nThe Audit and Valuation Committee is responsible for monitoring accounting processes and supervising the audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements. This committee also monitors the effectiveness of the company's internal control system, risk management and internal audit. In the 2023 financial year, Martin Němeček and Gayatri Narayan served as the Audit and Valuation Committee's financial experts based on their professional experience and knowledge of finance and accounting. The committee members, as a whole, are well informed of the real estate sector. The Audit and Valuation Committee held four meetings in 2023. These meetings were attended by 94% of the shareholder representatives.\n\n#### Strategy and ESG Committee\n\nThe Strategy and ESG Committee is responsible, above all, for the regular evaluation of the company's strategy and orientation, of which environmental, sustainability, social and governance topics (ESG) are an integral part. These responsibilities were fulfilled by the full Supervisory Board in the past financial year.\n\n#### Personnel and Nominating Committee\n\nThe Personnel and Nominating Committee makes recommendations to the Supervisory Board for nominations to the Executive and Supervisory Boards and is responsible for determining the remuneration and preparing the employment contracts for the Executive Board members. In addition, the committee reviews the remuneration policy for the Executive Board at regular intervals. In its capacity as a remuneration committee, the Personnel and Nominating Committee consisted of Gayatri Narayan as Chairwoman and at least one member with knowledge and experience in remuneration policy until 31 December 2023. The responsibilities were exercised by the full Supervisory Board in the past financial year.\n\n{10}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Supervisory Board qualification matrix\n\nAs in the previous years, the Supervisory Board also completed a routine annual self-evaluation of its working efficiency, above all with regard to its organisation and operating procedures. The focal points included, among others, the organisation of the Supervisory Board and the procedures at meetings, the activities of the committees, the provision of information to the Supervisory Board, the self-image of the Supervisory Board members as well as any recommendations for improvement.\n\nImage /page/10/Figure/3 description: This image is a table that shows the sectoral, functional, and governance expertise of four people: Miroslava Greštiaková, Martin Němeček, Martin Matula, and Gayatri Narayan. The table also shows the geographic experience of each person. The sectoral expertise includes real estate, capital markets, insurance, and finance. The functional expertise includes CEO/Management/Division Mgt., Compliance/Legal, Human Ressources, Accounting/Audit, Marketing, and Digital/Sustainability. The governance expertise includes Non Executive Dir. Experience and Governance (Corporate). The geographic experience is WE EE for all four people.

These reports (\"Directors' Dealings\") are published on the IMMOFINANZ website. Following is an overview of the direct and indirect shareholdings of these members as reported to the company:\n\n| Member           | Number of IMMOFINANZ<br>shares |\n|------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Philipp Obermair | 300                            |\n\n#### Working Procedures of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board\n\nThe cooperation between the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of IMMOFINANZ is based on open and constructive discussions. The Executive Board provides the Supervisory Board with regular, timely and comprehensive information on the development of business and related issues and also prepares the documentation for the Supervisory Board's meetings and resolutions. The rules of procedure for the Executive Board define the transactions and measures that require Supervisory Board approval. In addition, the Executive Board provides the Supervisory Board with information on issues of major importance outside the framework of scheduled meetings.\n\n#### Independence and avoidance of conflicts of interest\n\nThe members of the Executive Board are required to take their decisions independent of any personal interests and the interests of controlling shareholders. Moreover, these decisions must be based on well-founded knowledge and comply with all relevant legal regulations. Persons serving on the Executive Board must disclose any personal interests in the company's transactions or other conflicts of interest to the Supervisory Board without delay and inform their board colleagues. The Executive Board members may only accept appointments to a supervisory board with the consent of the IMMOFINANZ Supervisory Board. Key company employees must also have the approval of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board before they may accept a position on the corporate body of a non-Group company. A legal restraint on competition is also in place.\n\n{11}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board are required to represent the interests of the company and must disclose any conflicts of interest without delay. They may not accept positions on the corporate bodies of any companies that compete with IMMOFINANZ.\n\nThere are no contracts between the members of the Supervisory Board or companies in which a member of the Supervisory Board holds a significant financial interest, on the one hand, and IMMOFINANZ or one of its subsidiaries, on the other hand.\n\n#### Criteria for the independence of the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Austrian Corporate Governance Code (C-Rule 53) requires the majority of the supervisory board members elected by the annual general meeting to be independent of the company and its management board. A supervisory board member is considered to be independent when he or she has no business or personal relations with the company or its management board that constitute a material conflict of interest and are therefore capable of influencing the member's behaviour.\n\nThe following independence criteria were defined by the IMMOFINANZ Supervisory Board and reflect the standards listed in Annex 1 to the Corporate Governance Code:\n\n- The Supervisory Board member did not serve as a member of the Executive Board or a key employee of IMMOFINANZ or one of its subsidiaries during the past five years.\n- The Supervisory Board member does not currently, or did not in the past year, maintain any business relations with IMMOFINANZ or one of its subsidiaries of a scope considered significant for the Supervisory Board member. The same applies to business relationships with companies in which the Supervisory Board member holds a considerable economic interest, but not to exercising functions on IMMOFINANZ's corporate bodies. The approval of individual transactions by the Supervisory Board pursuant to L-Rule 48 does not automatically qualify the member as not independent.\n- The Supervisory Board member did not act as an auditor of IMMOFINANZ or own an investment in the auditing company or work for the auditing company during the past three years.\n- The Supervisory Board member is not a member of the management board of another company in which a member of the Executive Board of IMMOFINANZ serves on the supervisory board.\n- The Supervisory Board member has not served on the Supervisory Board of IMMOFINANZ for more than 15 years. This does not apply to members who are shareholders with a direct investment in IMMOFINANZ or who represent the interests of such a shareholder.\n- The Supervisory Board member is not closely related (direct offspring, spouse, life partner, parent, uncle, aunt, sibling, niece, nephew) to a member of the Executive Board or to persons specified in one of the above points.\n\nIn accordance with C-Rule 54 of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code, Miroslava Greštiaková and Gayatri Narayan (up to 31 December 2023) are free float representatives on the Supervisory Board. These two members of the Supervisory Board are neither shareholders with a stake of more than 10% nor do they represent the interests of shareholders with a stake of more than 10%.\n\n#### Support for women on the Executive Board and Supervisory Board and in key functions\n\nIn the interest of the company, appointments to the Executive Board, Supervisory Board and key positions are based solely on professional and personal qualifications.\n\nWomen filled 32.3% of the management positions in 2023 (2022: 27.5%) and represented 59.1% of the total workforce (2022: 57.1%). One woman serves on the Executive Board. The Supervisory Board is chaired by Miroslava Greštiaková, and Gayatri Narayan was another member until 31 December 2023; the percentage of women among shareholder representatives thus remained unchanged at a high level of 50% at the reporting date. At IMMOFINANZ, women hold key management positions in central corporate functions and on the local country boards.\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional measures to increase the share of women in management positions have not been defined to date. IMMOFINANZ supports the work-life balance through flexible and partially flexible working times as well as part-time work models for employees, parental leave for fathers or the one-month \"new baby break for dads\".\n\nMen and women have equal opportunities for advancement at IMMOFINANZ, and all employees receive performance-based remuneration for their work.\n\n#### Diversity concept\n\nIMMOFINANZ does not follow an abstractly defined diversity concept for appointments to the Executive Board or Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board, which is responsible for appointments to the Executive Board and for issuing recommendations to the annual general meeting for elections to the Supervisory Board, considers the diversity aspects listed in § 243c (2) no. 2a of the Austrian Commercial Code (age, gender, education and professional experience) and the international aspects for supervisory board members which are discussed in L-Rule 52 of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code to be very important. Accordingly, these aspects are acknowledged and considered in connection with specific appointment decisions or recommendations. However, the company does not consider it suitable or expedient to tie its decisions on recommendations or appointments to a diversity concept with abstractly defined goals.\n\n#### External evaluation\n\nIMMOFINANZ's compliance with the provisions of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code was evaluated by the auditor, Ernst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H., within the framework of a separate audit of the corporate governance report (pursuant to KFS/PG 13). The related auditor's report is available for review on IMMOFINANZ's website (https://immofinanz.com). The evaluation of the corporate governance report for 2023 did not result in any objections.\n\nVienna, 27 March 2024\n\nThe Executive Board\n\nRadka Doehring Pavel Měchura\n\nPavel Měchura\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-13-0\"></span>Group Management Report\n\n## General Principles\n\nIMMOFINANZ AG is the parent company of IMMOFINANZ Group. The increase in the investment in S IMMO to 50% plus one share was completed at year-end 2022. The assets and liabilities held by S IMMO have therefore been included in IMMOFINANZ's consolidated financial statements since 31 December 2022, and the income statement positions were included beginning with the first quarter of 2023. The designation \"IMMOFINANZ Group\" is used for information that includes S IMMO, while information excluding S IMMO is referred to as \"IMMOFINANZ\".\n\nIMMOFINANZ and S IMMO have complementary portfolios and are both present in the following countries: Austria, Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Croatia. IMMOFINANZ is also active in Poland, Serbia, Slovenia and Italy. The real estate portfolios of IMMOFINANZ and S IMMO consist primarily of commercial properties in the office and retail asset classes, but S IMMO also owns hotels and residential properties.\n\n## Economic Overview and Property Markets of IMMOFINANZ Group\n\nThe following section presents a selection of key economic indicators on the core markets of IMMOFINANZ Group. Included here are statistics on GDP growth, the inflation rate and the unemployment rate based on the winter forecast published by the European Commission in February 2024 and on current Eurostat and/or OECD data. This information is followed by a summary of developments in the individual real estate market segments where IMMOFINANZ Group is active. The information was drawn from market reports prepared by BNP Paribas, CBRE, JLL, Savills and EHL (data as of the end of Q3 or Q4 2023 according to availability).\n\nThe global economy remained weak throughout 2023. Numerous political conflicts adversely affected economic activity across the world and had a negative impact on European exports. In the European Union, this climate was intensified by measures implemented to counter the high inflation – whereby actions differed between the individual member states. The Union, as a whole, was somewhat more stable than the eurozone. Year-end statistics show growth of 0.2% for the entire Union and 0.1% for the eurozone (2022: 1.7% and 1.9%, respectively). GDP forecasts point to an increase of 1.3% for the EU in 2024 and 1.7% in 2025. The estimate for the eurozone is slightly lower at 1.2% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025. The high inflation caused by the strong increase in energy prices began to decrease during the year, but after-effects slowed the price declines for energy. Inflation equalled 3.4% in the EU and 2.9% in the eurozone at year-end 2023 (2022: 10.4% and 9.2%) and remained clearly above the ECB's target of 2.0%. The rapid acceleration of economic activity might impair the fight against inflation, but branch developments will vary significantly. Inflation is projected to equal 3.5% in 2024 and 2.4% in 2025 in the European Union and 3.2% and 2.2%, respectively, in the eurozone. Stable employment and a declining demographic trend led to a drop in unemployment, which equalled 5.9% in the EU (2022: 6.1%) and a slightly higher 6.4% in the eurozone at year-end 2023 (2022: 6.7%). Demographic developments are expected to support stable employment rates in the coming years. Unemployment in the \n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\nEU is estimated at 6.0% in 2024 and 5.9% in 2025. The eurozone should follow a similar course with an expected unemployment rate of 6.6% in 2024 and a decline to 6.4% in 2025.\n\nThe transaction volume on the European real estate market fell by roughly 47% to EUR 162.3 billion in 2023 (2022: EUR 305.2 billion). The fourth quarter volume amounted to EUR 44.9 billion, for a year-on-year decline of nearly 30% but an increase of 22% over the previous quarter. In contrast to the European trend, transaction volumes in the Scandinavian countries (+105%) and Southern Europe (+85%) were significantly higher compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. A sector analysis shows a drop of 40% to 60% on average in transaction volumes (office properties: -61%; retail properties: -42%). The hotel segment proved to be more crisis resistant with a decline of only 13% in the transaction volume.\n\nA market recovery is expected in 2024 but will only become visible in the second half-year. Completed transactions show signs of a clear trend towards premium properties. The current market conditions will separate the wheat from the chaff, with a decline in the demand for second-class properties. A similar development is also apparent in the rental business: Tenants are now much more reserved when planning space than before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Austria\n\nThe Austrian economy suffered from high energy prices, rising unit labour costs and weak export activity in 2023. GDP growth in the fourth quarter was only 0.2% higher than in the previous quarter, and a review of the entire year shows a decline of 1.3% versus 2022 (2022: +4.8%). Growth rates of 1.0% and 1.3%, respectively, are forecasted for 2024 and 2025. Support is expected from the lower level of inflation and resulting increase in consumer demand. Inflation eased during 2023 and equalled 5.7% at year-end (2022: 8.6%). This trend should also continue in the coming years: Inflation is projected to equal 4.1% in 2024 and 3.0% in 2025. The unemployment rate increased during 2023 and reached 5.6% at the end of December (2022: 4.9%), but a gradual reduction to 5.4% and 5.3% is forecasted for the next two years.\n\nThe transaction volume on the Austrian real estate market totalled EUR 2.8 billion in 2023 (2022: EUR 4.0 billion), for a year-on-year decline of roughly 37%. Office properties were responsible for most of this volume at EUR 1.2 billion, followed by retail properties at EUR 785 million. Prime yields rose to 5.0% (2022: 3.5%) for offices and to 5.65% (2022: 5.0%) for retail parks.\n\n#### OFFICE\n\nThe office market in Vienna had 11.6 million sqm of modern space at the end of 2023. Take-up was similar to the previous year at 174,000 sqm (2022: 171,000 sqm). New office completions dropped to 45,800 sqm (2022: 126,000 sqm). The vacancy rate fell slightly again to 3.6% (2022: 3.9%), while prime rents increased marginally to EUR 28.00/sqm/month.\n\n#### RETAIL\n\nThe Austrian retail market covered 13.6 million sqm at year-end 2023. Consumer confidence in this country was below the European average during the past year and led to noticeable restraint on the part of buyers. Offside the premium locations, retailers were faced with turnover declines. Prime rents for retail parks equalled EUR 15.0/sqm/month, and prime yields increased to 5.65% (2022: 5.0%).\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Germany\n\nHigh inflation, declining purchasing power, a changing interest environment and weak export demand had a negative impact on growth in this country during 2023. The German GDP fell by 0.2% in year-on-year comparison (2022: +1.8%). Experts see an increase in private consumption during the next two years due to the decline in inflation and stronger export demand. These two factors should support growth of 0.8% in 2024 and 1.2% in 2025. Inflation fell to 3.8% at the end of 2023 (2022: 9.6%), and expert opinions point to a continuation of this trend. Consequently, inflation could equal 3.1% in 2024 and decline further to 2.2% in 2025. The unemployment rate equalled 3.1% at year-end (2022: 2.9%), and a stable level of 3.2% is projected for the following two years.\n\nThe commercial property market in Germany reported a volume of EUR 23.3 billion in 2023 (2022: EUR 54.1 billion), which represents a year-on-year decrease of roughly 57%. Significant declines were recorded, above all, at prime locations with a minus of 67% and apparently reflect the more difficult financing conditions. The transaction volume in Düsseldorf fell to EUR 882 million (2022: EUR 2.9 billion) and, with a reduction of 69%, followed the national trend. Prime yields rose to 4.2% in Munich, followed by Berlin and Hamburg with 4.25% each (2022: Munich 3.2%; Berlin 3.2%; Hamburg 3.3%). In Düsseldorf, prime yields rose from 3.4% in the previous year to 4.5%.\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/4 description: The image shows the word \"OFFICE\" in a simple, sans-serif font. The text is light blue.\n\nDüsseldorf had 9.7 million sqm of modern office space at the end of 2023. Take-up declined by 4% to 280,000 sqm primarily due to a weak first half-year (2022: 291,000 sqm). The production of new space was slightly lower at 290,000 sqm (2022: 343,000 sqm). Despite increased rent levels, vacancies fell to 9.4% (2022: 10.9%). The interest rate hikes were responsible for an increase in prime yields to 4.5% (2022: 3.4%). Prime rents in premium properties rose to EUR 40.0/sqm/month, and average rents ranged from EUR 19.40 to EUR 20.90/sqm/ month (2022: EUR 16.50 to EUR 19.40/sqm/month).\n\nImage /page/15/Picture/6 description: A modern, curved white building with many windows is shown against a blue sky. The building has a unique design with rounded edges and a wave-like shape. The windows are rectangular and evenly spaced across the facade. The building appears to be an office building or apartment complex.\n\n## Romania\n\nExperts' forecasts place growth for the Romanian economy in 2023 at 2.2% (2022: 5.0%). The sharp rise in energy and food prices weakened purchasing power and had a negative effect on economic momentum. The next two years are expected to bring an improvement in purchasing power and renewed growth of 3.1% and 3.4%. Inflation dropped to 7.0% at the end of the year (2022: 12.0%) but remained above the eurozone level. Declining prices should reduce inflation to 5.9% in 2024 and 3.4% in 2025. In spite of the challenging economic conditions, the unemployment rate in Romania was stable and equalled 5.4% at yearend (2022: 5.6%). The employment situation should remain constant with an unemployment rate of 5.2% and 5.3% in the coming two years.\n\nWith transactions totalling EUR 499 million (2022: EUR 1.3 billion), the volume on the Romanian commercial property market fell by more than 60% in 2023. The retail segment was responsible for most of the transactions with a market share of roughly 57% or EUR 284 million. Office property transactions declined to a market share of 17% or EUR 85 million. Prime yields for shopping centers rose by 50 basis points to 7.75% (2022: 7.25%) and for office properties by 75 basis points to 7.75% (2022: 7.0%).\n\n{16}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### OFFIC RETAIL\n\nThe office market in Bucharest had 3.41 million sqm of modern space at year-end 2023. Completions totalled 110,000 sqm (2022: 124,400 sqm) and, at the time this report was prepared, a further 16,100 sqm were under construction. Take-up rose by 62% to 476,000 sqm (2022: 295,300 sqm), and vacancies increased to 14.7% at the end of December (2022: 14.1%). Prime rents in the city center equalled EUR 19.5/sqm/month.\n\nRomania had 4.34 million sqm of modern retail space at the time this report was prepared. The properties completed in 2023 had a combined total of 251,000 sqm (2022: 86,700 sqm), whereby 87% represented locations outside the Bucharest metropolitan region. An additional 258,000 sqm (2022: 265,000 sqm) of retail space are currently under construction and should be completed in 2024. Rents in the high-turnover locations rose by 7%. Prime rents equalled EUR 80.0/sqm/month in shopping centers and EUR 8.0 to EUR 15.0/sqm/month in retail parks.\n\n### Poland\n\nEconomic growth was limited to 0.4% by high inflation and weak export activity in 2023 (2022: 4.9%), but a trend reversal is expected in 2024. Forecasts show an increase to 2.7% and further recovery to 3.2% by 2025. Inflation had fallen to 6.2% by the end of 2023 (2022: 13.2%) and is expected to remain at this level in 2024 but decrease to 3.8% in the following year due to a decline in energy and food prices. The Polish labour market is still characterised by scarce supply. The unemployment rate equalled 2.7% at year-end (2022: 2.9%) and should fluctuate only slightly in the next two years with 2.8% and 2.7%.\n\nThe commercial real estate market in Poland recorded a sharp drop of 65% to EUR 2.1 billion in 2023 (2022: EUR 5.9 billion). Industrial and logistics properties generated the highest transaction volume with a market share of 46% or EUR 965 million (2022: EUR 2.0 billion). Transactions in retail properties fell by nearly 70% to EUR 430 million (2022: EUR 1.5 billion) and a market share of 21%. Office properties ranked third with a decline of 79% to EUR 429 million (2022: EUR 2.1 billion) and a market share of 21%. Yields increased to 6.0% (2022: 5.25%) for office properties and to 6.5% (2022: 6.25%) for retail properties. Retail park yields equalled 7.25%.\n\n#### OFFICE\n\nOffice space totalling 61,000 sqm was completed on the Warsaw office market in 2023 (2022: 232,000 sqm). That represents the lowest level since 2010 and brought the total supply to 6.2 million sqm. An additional 238,000 sqm were under construction at the time this report was prepared. Take-up declined by 13% to 748,800 sqm in 2023 (2022: 860,000 sqm). Vacancies fell to 10.4% (2022: 11.6%) by the end of the year, and prime rents in the Warsaw city center rose to EUR 29.0/sqm/month.\n\n#### RETAIL\n\nThe supply of retail space grew by 563,400 sqm in 2023 (2022: 360,000 sqm), whereby 63% is attributable to the retail park segment. Poland had 13.8 million sqm of modern retail space at the end of the year; a further 430,000 sqm (2022: 350,000 sqm) are currently under construction and should be completed in 2024. Prime rents in the retail parks were stable and ranged from EUR 9.5 to EUR 12.0/sqm/month.\n\n{17}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Slovakia\n\nThe Slovakian economy grew by 1.3% in 2023 (2022: 1.7%) according to the experts, notwithstanding the high inflation. This development was based on a high level of investments and extensive exports to the neighbouring European countries. In line with this trend, Slovakia could generate growth of 1.7% and 2.0% in the next two years. Inflation equalled 6.6% at the end of December 2023 (2022: 12.1%) and is forecasted to decline to 5.2% in 2024 and to 3.0% in 2025. The unemployment rate reflected the previous year with 5.8% at year-end (2022: 5.8%) and could decrease to 5.4% and 5.2% in the coming two years due to an improvement in the overall economic situation.\n\nThe transaction volume on the commercial investment market in Slovakia fell by 41% to EUR 664 million in 2023 (2022: EUR 1.1 billion). Office properties were the main driver with a market share of 70% or EUR 467 million (2022: EUR 624 million), followed ex aequo by retail properties with 14% or EUR 93 million (2022: EUR 350 million) and industrial and logistics properties with 14% or EUR 93 million (2022: EUR 147 million). Prime yields increased to 6.0% (2022: 5.5%) in the office segment and to 6.5% (2022: 6.3%) for shopping centers.\n\n#### OFFICE\n\nThe market for modern office properties in Bratislava covered 2.1 million sqm at the end of 2023. Completions totalled 114,000 sqm, with a significant decline in the space under construction to 21,000 sqm (2022: 119,000 sqm). The vacancy rate rose noticeably to 14.2% (2022: 11.2%) and turnover amounted to 183,500 sqm. Prime rents increased from EUR 17.0 to EUR 18.0/sqm/month. Average rents followed this trend and equalled EUR 15.50/sqm/ month at year-end.\n\n#### RETAIL\n\nThe supply of retail space in Slovakia remained nearly unchanged in year-on-year comparison at 2.4 million sqm in 2023 (2022: 2.4 million sqm). A total of 76,000 sqm are currently under development (2022: 100,000 sqm). The high inflation rate was reflected in rental price adjustments during the past year. Prime rents equalled EUR 67.0/sqm/month for shopping centers in Bratislava and EUR 15.0/sqm/month for retail parks. Prime yields rose by 20 basis points to 6.5% for shopping centers and by 35 basis points to 7.15% for retail parks.\n\n## Czech Republic\n\nThe Czech economy virtually stagnated in 2023 with a decline of 0.2% (2022: +2.5%). Growth was slowed by measures introduced to reduce inflation and weak economic development in the neighbouring countries. Friendlier market conditions should support an increase of 1.4% in 2024 and further sound recovery to 3.0% in 2025. Inflation equalled 7.6% at the end of 2023 (2022: 14.8%) and should drop to 3.2% in 2024 due to a decline in energy prices before falling to 2.4% in 2025. The labour shortage in the Czech Republic was still visible at year-end. The unemployment rate equalled 2.8% at the end of December 2023 (2022: 2.3%) and should remain stable at 2.5% in each of the coming two years.\n\nThe transaction market in the Czech Republic declined by 16% to a volume of EUR 1.4 billion in 2023 (2022: EUR 1.6 billion), whereby the traditionally strong fourth quarter proved to be disappointing. Retail properties were the most popular asset class in the last 12 months with a share of 45%, followed by office properties at 26%. Prime yields increased from 4.8% to 5.4% for office properties and from 6.25% to 6.3% for retail properties.\n\n{18}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### OFFICE\n\nThe office market in Prague had roughly 3.9 million sqm of modern space at the end of 2023. Completions totalled 98,400 sqm, and an additional 100,000 sqm (2022: 293,600 sqm) were under construction at the time this report was prepared. Takeup reflected the previous year at 541,900 sqm (2022: 550,100 sqm), and the vacancy rate declined to 7.2% (2022: 7.7%) due to the limited construction activity. Prime rents increased to EUR 27.5/sqm/ month, and average rents at good locations ranged from EUR 17.75 to EUR 18.25/sqm/month. Prime yields rose to 5.4%.\n\n#### RETAIL\n\nThe supply of retail space remained constant during the past year and totalled roughly 2.5 million sqm at year-end. A total of 24,000 sqm are currently under construction. 18 months of declining retail turnover ended with a trend reversal in November 2023. Rising interest rates led to an increase of 10 basis points in prime yields to 6.35% for shopping centers as well as retail parks.\n\n### Hungary\n\nForecasts indicate a continuation of the recession in Hungary during 2023, which led to a GDP decline of 0.7% (2022: +4.9%). This development was a result of high inflation combined with tax and monetary measures. However, recovery is expected in 2024 with growth of 2.4% and a further increase to 3.6% in 2025. Inflation had fallen to 5.5% by the end of the year (2022: 15.3%) and, consistent with this trend, should decline further to 5.2% in 2024 and to 4.1% in 2025. The unemployment rate equalled 4.2% at the end of the year (2022: 4.0%) and should remain relatively constant at 4.2% and 4.1% in the next two years.\n\nThe transaction volume on the commercial real estate market in Hungary fell by 69% to EUR 441 million in 2023 (2022: EUR 1.4 billion). Prime yields rose to 6.75% (2022: 6.0%) for office properties, to 6.0% (2022: 5.75%) for shopping centers and to 7.25% (2022: 6.5%) for retail parks.\n\n#### OFFICE\n\nThe office market in Budapest has 4.5 million sqm of modern space. Take-up fell by 10% to 352,000 sqm in 2023 (2022: 391,700 sqm). Completions totalled 180,000 sqm (2022: 247,000 sqm), and a further 180,000 sqm are currently under construction. The vacancy rate rose to 13.3% as a result of the new completions (2022: 11.3%). Average rents were slightly higher at EUR 14.2/sqm/month, and prime rents equalled EUR 25.0/sqm/month.\n\n#### RETAIL\n\nRetail turnover fell by 10% in 2023, primarily due to the high inflation. Completions totalled 10,300 sqm, and a further 27,000 sqm are in the development pipeline. Consequently, the supply of space will also be limited in the coming years and should generally lead to an increase in rents. Prime yields for shopping centers rose slightly to 6.0%.\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Adriatic\n\nIMMOFINANZ's Adriatic region includes Serbia, Slovenia, Croatia and Italy. The economies in these countries followed the European trend with growth ranging from 2.6% in Croatia to 0.7% in Italy. Serbia is expected to generate the strongest growth in the coming years with an increase of 3.1% in 2024 and 3.7% in 2025. Italy trails behind with expected growth of 0.9% in 2024 and 1.2% in 2025. The inflation rate equalled 8.1% in Croatia, followed by 7.5% in Slovenia and 6.1% in Italy at the end of 2023. Slovenia will presumably take longest for inflation to subside: The inflation rate is projected to equal 3.9% in 2024 and 2.4% in 2025. Unemployment was highest in Serbia with 9.4% at the end of the year. A dynamic reduction in unemployment is forecasted for Serbia and Croatia – down to 8.6% in Serbia in the next two years and from 6.5% in 2023 to 5.8% in Croatia. The labour markets in Slovenia and Italy have shown sidewards development, whereby Slovenia's unemployment rate should remain at a low 3.6%. According to the experts, Italy will only be able to marginally reduce its traditionally high unemployment to 7.3%.\n\nAmong the commercial property markets in this region, Italy is by far the most important. It declined by 49% to a transaction volume of EUR 6.1 billion in 2023 (2022: EUR 11.7 billion). Prime yields in Italy rose by 35 basis points to 4.25% (2022: 3.9%) for offices and by 1.2 percentage points to 7.5% (2022: 6.3%) for shopping centers. Prime yields in Serbia were uniform at 8.75% (2022: 8.0%) and, in Croatia, equalled 7.3% (2022: 6.8%) for retail properties and 8.3% (2022: 7.8%) for offices. In Slovenia, the prime yields for retail properties equalled 7.8% (2022: 7.3%).\n\n### Hotels\n\nThe Austrian hotel market continued along a recovery course in 2023. With nearly 151 million overnight stays, the record 2019 level was only just missed. Indicators reflected a similar level to 2022for domestic travellers in 2023, while growth was driven mainly by the return of international tourists. This segment increased by 13.5% year-on-year. According to CBRE, steady growth in overnight stays can be expected in 2024 – above all from overseas travellers.\n\nThe hotel market in the CEE region also recorded positive development, supported by the increasing recovery of tourism. This trend can be expected to continue.\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-20-0\"></span>Portfolio Report\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group concentrates on its core business as a growth-oriented property owner and on the continuous optimisation of its portfolio. Its activities also include acquisitions and selected development projects, whereby the focus is on high-yield properties.\n\nThe portfolio strategy followed by IMMOFINANZ Group is based on flexible and innovative offers with high customer orientation. Active portfolio management ensures that the properties are attractive for tenants and consistent with the principle of sustainability from a social and environmental perspective. In this way, IMMOFINANZ Group is also optimally positioned to meet the future needs of tenants and consumers in the retail business and tenants and their staffs in the office sector.\n\n### The IMMOFINANZ Group's property portfolio\n\nThe IMMOFINANZ Group's property portfolio (IMMOFINANZ including S IMMO) included 518 properties<sup>\\*</sup> with a combined value<sup>\\*</sup> of EUR 8,174.3 million as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 627 properties with a carrying amount of EUR 8,363.8 million). Standing investments<sup>\\*</sup> represented the largest component at EUR 7,840.2 million, or 95.9% of the carrying amount, and 3.6 million sqm of rentable space<sup>\\*</sup> which generate steady rental income. Development projects<sup>\\*</sup> are responsible for EUR 138.3 million, or 1.7% of the carrying amount. A carrying amount of EUR 195.8 million, or 2.4%, is attributable to pipeline projects<sup>\\*</sup> and includes future planned development projects, undeveloped land and real estate inventories. The owner-operated S IMMO hotels (Vienna Marriott, Budapest Marriott and Novotel Bucharest City Center) with 61,075 sqm of total rentable space are not included in this portfolio report.\n\nThe application of IFRS 16 since the first quarter of 2019 leads to differences between the amounts presented in the portfolio report and on the balance sheet. Expert appraisals or internal valuation form the basis for the property values in the portfolio report. The reported property values on the balance sheet also include capitalised rights of use for building rights.\n\nThe presentation in the portfolio report is based on the primary use of the properties.\n\n| Property portfolio | Number of<br>properties | Standing<br>investments<br>in MEUR | Development<br>projects<br>in MEUR | Pipeline<br>projects<br>in MEUR1 | Property<br>portfolio<br>in MEUR | Property<br>portfolio<br>in % |\n|--------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Austria            | 20                      | 381.7                              | 0.0                                | 9.2                              | 390.9                            | 4.8                           |\n| Germany            | 5                       | 467.6                              | 0.0                                | 4.5                              | 472.1                            | 5.8                           |\n| Poland             | 29                      | 936.9                              | 28.5                               | 0.0                              | 965.4                            | 11.8                          |\n| Czech Republic     | 72                      | 933.6                              | 0.0                                | 0.0                              | 933.6                            | 11.4                          |\n| Hungary            | 19                      | 224.8                              | 0.0                                | 2.7                              | 227.5                            | 2.8                           |\n| Romania            | 32                      | 595.8                              | 65.1                               | 72.0                             | 732.9                            | 9.0                           |\n| Slovakia           | 35                      | 428.1                              | 0.0                                | 1.3                              | 429.4                            | 5.3                           |\n| Adriatic2          | 62                      | 584.9                              | 28.0                               | 34.6                             | 647.6                            | 7.9                           |\n| S IMMO             | 244                     | 3,286.8                            | 16.7                               | 71.5                             | 3,375.0                          | 41.3                          |\n| IMMOFINANZ Group   | 518                     | 7,840.2                            | 138.3                              | 195.8                            | 8,174.3                          | 100.0                         |\n| in %               |                         | 95.9                               | 1.7                                | 2.4                              | 100.0                            |                               |\n\n#### The IMMOFINANZ Group property portfolio by core market and classification\n\n1 Including real estate inventories\n\n2 In declining order based on the carrying amount: Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia and Italy\n\n<sup>∗</sup> Including properties held by IMMOFINANZ Group that are held for sale and fall under IFRS 5 (31 December 2023: EUR 255.9 million;

These properties are located, above all, in the core markets of Austria, Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Adriatic (Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia and Italy). Standing investments<sup>\\*</sup> represent the largest component at EUR 4,553.4 million, or 94.9% of the carrying amount, and 2.1 million sqm of rentable space<sup>\\*</sup>. Development projects<sup>\\*</sup> are responsible for EUR 121.6 million, or 2.5% of the carrying amount. A carrying amount of EUR 124.3 million, or 2.6%, is attributable to pipeline projects<sup>\\*</sup>.\n\n#### Acquisitions and sales by IMMOFINANZ\n\nIMMOFINANZ continued the strategic expansion of its high-yield retail portfolio during 2023 by acquiring 22 complementary retail properties in the Czech Republic during the fourth quarter and, in a second step, a retail park and a shopping center from CPI Property Group (CPIPG). These properties have nearly 107,300 sqm of rentable space in total, are almost fully rented, and generate approximately EUR 17 million (gross) of annual rental income. The combined property value amounted to roughly EUR 237 million. These transactions will strengthen IMMOFINANZ's earning power and position on the attractive Czech retail market.\n\nProperty sales (including S IMMO) totalled EUR 751.1 million in 2023. Included here, among others, are the Bureau am Belvedere office building in Vienna with nearly 9,000 sqm as well as land in Romania and in Turkey. Other sales involved transactions by S IMMO in Germany and an office property in Croatia.\n\nIn February 2023, IMMOFINANZ signed a letter of intent to sell several office properties at the location on Vienna's Wienerberg to S IMMO. This transaction covered six standing investments with roughly 128,000 sqm of rentable space and one development project which was opened in the third quarter of 2023. The transaction volume totalled approximately EUR 411 million.\n\nThis agreement included the sale by IMMOFINANZ of the Vienna Twin Towers office building to S IMMO in July 2023. The agreement with S IMMO was completed with the sale of five further office properties and one hotel building in October 2023. The IMMOFINANZ team remains in charge of the administration and rental of the properties at the Wienerberg location, most of which operate under the innovative myhive brand.\n\nAs IMMOFINANZ holds a controlling interest of 50% plus one share in S IMMO, this transaction will have no effect on the Group's asset, financial or earnings position.\n\nIn addition, IMMOFINANZ sold the Grand Center Zagreb office building to a Croatian property company and two office properties in Vienna to an Austrian real estate investor after the reporting period in the first quarter 2024.\n\n<sup>\\*</sup> Including properties held by IMMOFINANZ that are held for sale and fall under IFRS 5 (31 December 2023: EUR 171.4 million; see section 4.10 in the consolidated financial statements for details).\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\n## The S IMMO property portfolio\n\nThe S IMMO property portfolio (excluding owner-operated hotel properties) included 244 properties as of 31 December 2023. These properties had a combined carrying amount of EUR 3,375.0 million (31 December 2022: 362 properties with a carrying amount of EUR 3,164.2 million) and rentable space of 1.4 million sqm (31 December 2022: 1.4 million sqm).\n\nFor further information on the property portfolio, see the S IMMO AG annual report as of 31 December 2023.\n\n## The IMMOFINANZ Group's standing investments\n\nThe IMMOFINANZ Group's standing investment portfolio includes 432 properties. Acquisitions and the completion of development projects more than offset strategic sales, and the carrying amount of the portfolio totalled EUR 7,840.2 million as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 530 properties with a carrying amount of EUR 7,936.0 million). Of this total, 24.4% are attributable to office properties, 33.5% to retail properties and 41.9% to S IMMO. The focal point of the standing investments by segments based on the carrying amount are the markets in Poland (EUR 936.9 million), the Czech Republic (EUR 933.6 million) and Romania (EUR 595.8 million) as well as S IMMO (EUR 3,286.8 million). The rentable space in this portfolio totalled 3.6 million sqm. The standing investment portfolio had a gross return of 7.2% based on IFRS rental income, whereby rental incentives – e.g. the standard market practice of granting rent-free periods or allowances for fit-out costs – are accrued on a straight-line basis over the contract term in accordance with IFRS. The occupancy rate equalled 92.2% (31 December 2022: 92.9%).\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### The IMMOFINANZ Group's standing investments by core market\n\n| Standing

carrying amount of EUR 4,553.4 million as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 208 standing investments with a carrying amount of EUR 4,852.1 million). Of this total, 42.0% are attributable to office properties and 57.7% to retail properties. The rentable space totalled 2.1 million sqm (31 December 2022: 2.2 million sqm). The properties in this portfolio have a gross return of 7.5% based on IFRS rental income.\n\n#### Occupancy rate increased to 95.6%\n\nThe occupancy rate increased to 95.6% (31 December 2022: 94.3%). According to the EPRA's calculation formula, the vacancy rate equalled 5.1% (31 December 2022: 6.5%). The EPRA vacancy rate is based on the ratio of the estimated market rent for the vacant space in the standing investments to the total estimated market rent for the standing investment portfolio. Take-up in the standing investments and development projects (excluding standing investments in the Other asset class) amounted to 374,300 sqm in 2023 (2022: 317,300 sqm). This take-up includes roughly 129,400 sqm of new rentals and roughly 244,900 sqm of contract extensions. The average unexpired lease term weighted by rental income (WAULT<sup>\\*</sup>) equalled 3.6 years as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 3.5 years).\n\n#### Contract expiration profile for IMMOFINANZ: standing investments (total)\n\nFixed-term contracts until the end of the term and open-ended contracts as of the earliest possible exit date in relation to the total rented space (in GLA space1, excluding S IMMO):\n\n| 1 year in % | 2 years in % | 3 years in % | 4 years in % | 5 years in % | > 5 years in % | > 10 years in % |\n|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| 14          | 13           | 17           | 12           | 16           | 19             | 7               |\n\n1 Gross lettable area: the total area available to tenants for their exclusive use; excludes common areas, e.g. traffic, parking and service areas, etc.\n\n#### Sustainability certification\n\nThe certified space totalled roughly 958,800 sqm at the end of December 2023 in buildings with a combined carrying amount of EUR 2.6 billion. Sustainability certificates have therefore been issued for 57.5% of the carrying amount, respectively 44.7% of the total space in the standing investment portfolio. In the office business, certification covered 90.4% of the properties based on the carrying amount and 77.3% of the total space.\n\n#### Further sound growth of 8.5% in like-for-like rental income for IMMOFINANZ\n\nA like-for-like analysis (i.e. acquisitions, completions and sales are deducted to facilitate comparison with earlier periods) shows a further improvement of 8.5%, or EUR 22.9 million, to EUR 292.3 million in 2023, after EUR 269.5 million in the previous year. Positive development was reported by all core markets.

The STOP SHOP retail park in Đakovo opened in November 2023.\n\n#### Romania\n\nThe myhive Victoria Park, an existing office property in Bucharest, underwent extensive modernisation and integration in the flexible myhive office concept. The project was completed in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\n## The IMMOFINANZ Group's pipeline projects\n\nPipeline projects include future planned development projects, undeveloped land and/or temporarily suspended projects. These projects had a carrying amount of EUR 195.8 million as of 31 December 2023 and represent 2.4% of the IMMOFINANZ Group's total portfolio. Of this total, EUR 124.3 million, or 2.6%, are attributable to IMMOFINANZ, excluding S IMMO (31 December 2022: EUR 159.3 million, or 3.1%). S IMMO is responsible for EUR 71.5 million. The focal point of the IMMOFINANZ Group's pipeline projects is Romania with a volume of EUR 72.0 million. IMMOFINANZ Group plans to further reduce the scope of its pipeline projects – especially the land reserves in Romania – through strategic sales.\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-31-0\"></span>Property Valuation\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and arranges for the regular appraisal of its properties by independent experts. This external valuation is carried out at least once every year as of 31 December and reflects the EPRA's Best Practices Policy Recommendations for the application of the fair value method as defined in IFRS.\n\nThe valuation includes property-related factors like the occupancy rate, rental income and the length of the rental contracts as well as the age and quality of the buildings. External factors are also taken into account, e.g. the development of the regional and general market environments, the economy and the financing climate. ESG aspects such as the risks arising from climate change, energy efficiency and the social added value of the properties are also examined and the potential impact on property values in the future are identified. CBRE, an independent company, was responsible for appraising 55.8% of IMMOFINANZ Group's portfolio (EUR 8.2 billion) as of 31 December 2023. S IMMO and its valuation covered 41.3%, and only 2.9% were valued internally by IMMOFINANZ Group.\n\n#### IMMOFINANZ Group: development of property valuation in 2023\n\nTotal revaluations (including property development and property sales) for IMMOFINANZ Group equalled EUR -376.8 million in 2023 (2022: EUR -105.7 million) and reflect the challenging market environment with its sharp rise in interest rates and continuing high construction costs. The revaluation results for investment property (standing investments and land reserves) amounted to EUR -352.0 million, compared with EUR -110.5 million in the previous year. The S IMMO portfolio was responsible for -3.5% of the carrying amount. The IMMOFINANZ office properties recorded valuation declines of EUR -242.3 million, or -13.4% of the carrying amount as of 31 December 2023, whereby the largest individual effects were recorded from office buildings in Düsseldorf, Vienna and Warsaw. Revaluation increases in the retail segment equalled EUR 5.0 million, or 0.2% of the carrying amount, and are mainly attributable to the acquisitions made in the Czech Republic in the fourth quarter.\n\n| Investment property | Carrying amount in MEUR | Valuation effects 2023 in MEUR | Ratio of valuation to carrying amount in %

This rating and outlook were confirmed during the annual review process in January 2022. The rating was raised to BBB (outlook: negative) in June 2022 based on IMMOFINANZ's membership in CPI Property Group (CPIPG). In October 2022, CPIPG's rating was adjusted to BBB- (outlook: stable), and IMMOFINANZ AG's rating also changed to BBB- (outlook: stable). IMMOFINANZ withdrew its individual rating for efficiency reasons in March 2023 due to its group affiliation to CPIPG.\n\nIn connection with the issue of the corporate bond 2020–2027, IMMOFINANZ has committed to comply with the following standard financial covenants. These covenants are calculated on the basis of the consolidated IFRS financial statements:\n\n| Financial covenant               | Threshold in % | Value as of 31 12 2023 in % |\n|----------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------|\n| Net Debt to Value Ratio1         | Max. 60.0      | 41.3                        |\n| Secured Net Debt to Value Ratio1 | Max. 45.0      | 31.9                        |\n| Interest Coverage Ratio          | Min. 150.0     | 245.6                       |\n\n1 The values are based on the latest calculation as per the bond terms on or before 31 December 2023.\n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-37-0\"></span>Business Development\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group generated strong growth in rental income and operating results in 2023. This sound development was supported, above all, by the full consolidation of S IMMO and the acquisition of retail properties as well as a substantial improvement in like-for-like rental income. Rental income rose by roughly 78% yearon-year to EUR 533.6 million, and the results of asset management were even 85.1% higher than the previous year at EUR 418.5 million. The results of property sales amounted to EUR -38.3 million (2022: EUR 4.6 million) and were influenced primarily by the reclassification to profit or loss of historical foreign exchange effects following the deconsolidation of a subsidiary in Turkey during the second quarter of 2023 (EUR -45.8 million). The results of operations increased substantially by nearly 85% to EUR 285.1 million in spite of this effect.\n\nRevaluations (including property development and property sales) totalled EUR -376.8 million, compared with EUR -105.7 million in the previous year. This reduction reflects the challenging market environment, which is influenced by the sharp rise in interest rates. Financial results declined to EUR -246.1 million (2022: EUR -72.6 million), primarily due to the absence of positive non-cash valuation effects from 2022. In addition, the earnings contributions from S IMMO are no longer included under financial results due to the full consolidation. Net profit recorded by IMMOFINANZ Group for the 2023 financial year therefore decreased to EUR -229.5 million and earnings per share equalled EUR -1.31.\n\n### Income statement\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                       |          |         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|\n|                                                           | 2023     | 2022    |\n| Rental income                                             | 533,601  | 300,170 |\n| Results of asset management                               | 418,538  | 226,103 |\n| Results of owner-operated hotel properties                | 2,012    | 0       |\n| Results of property sales                                 | -38,327  | 4,623   |\n| Results of property development                           | -25,591  | -20,684 |\n| Other operating income                                    | 7,853    | 10,377  |\n| Other operating expenses                                  | -79,367  | -66,078 |\n| Results of operations                                     | 285,118  | 154,341 |\n| Revaluation result from standing investments and goodwill | -352,207 | 103,974 |\n| Operating profit (EBIT)                                   | -67,089  | 258,315 |\n| Financial results                                         | -246,059 | -72,617 |\n| Earnings before tax (EBT)                                 | -313,148 | 185,698 |\n| Net profit or loss                                        | -229,461 | 141,969 |\n\nRental income recorded by IMMOFINANZ Group rose by 77.8% to EUR 533.6 million in 2023. This increase is chiefly attributable to the full consolidation of S IMMO and the acquisition of retail properties as well as a substantial 8.5% increase in like-for-like rental income. The improvement in the results of asset management exceeded the increase in rental income with a plus of 85.1% to EUR 418.5 million (2022: EUR 226.1 million).\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group continued its strategic property sales in 2023 with a volume of EUR 751.1 million. These sales consisted primarily of strategic transactions by S IMMO in Germany and an office property in Croatia as well as the sale of a Vienna office property and land in Turkey and in Romania by IMMOFINANZ. The results of property sales amounted to EUR -38.3 million (2022: EUR 4.6 million), whereby a negative earnings effect of EUR -45.8 million resulted from the deconsolidation of a subsidiary in Turkey during the second quarter of 2023 (2022: EUR 5.4 million). This negative element resulted almost entirely from the reclassification to profit or loss of historical foreign exchange effects due to the devaluation of the Turkish lira since the initial consolidation. These foreign exchange effects were previously recorded under comprehensive income without recognition to profit or loss. A contrasting factor was a purchase price receivable of EUR 7.0 million which was recognised in 2023 financial year and was paid in 2024. It resulted from the sale of the Russian portfolio in 2017 and was scheduled for settlement in the first half of 2022. Due to the war in Ukraine and the related sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation together with the related effects – especially the payment restrictions imposed in Russia – management viewed this receivable as presumably uncollectible and the receivable was subsequently written off in full at EUR -12.9 million in 2022.\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe results of property development amounted to EUR -25.6 million (2022: EUR -20.7 million) and reflected market trends and rising construction costs.\n\n#### Results of operations\n\nOther operating expenses rose to EUR -79.4 million (2022: EUR -66.1 million), mainly due to the full consolidation of S IMMO, the outsourcing of various activities to the service companies of CPI Property Group together with the related management fees that cannot be directly allocated to asset management, and to provisions for legal disputes in Romania. Legal, audit and consulting fees declined from EUR -19.4 million in 2022 to EUR - 13.9 million in 2023. This reduction reflected the absence of expenses recognised in 2022 for a Group-wide digitalisation project and expenses related to the takeover offers by CPI Property Group and S IMMO.\n\nThe results of operations increased by a substantial 84.7% to EUR 285.1 million (2022: EUR 154.3 million).\n\n#### Valuation results and EBIT\n\nResults from the valuation of standing investments and goodwill reflected the general market trends and turned negative at EUR -352.2 million, compared with EUR 104.0 million in the previous year. The decline in IMMOFINANZ Group's portfolio equalled -4.5% of the carrying amount as of 31 December 2023. Negative valuation results were responsible for a decrease in operating profit (EBIT) to EUR -67.1 million (2022: EUR 258.3 million) despite the strong operating results recorded in 2023.\n\n#### Financial results\n\nFinancing costs rose to EUR -210.0 million (2022: EUR -77.8 million), chiefly due to the full consolidation of S IMMO as well as an increase in financing costs. Other financial results fell to EUR -119.5 million (2022: EUR 149.1 million) based on the non-cash valuation of interest rate derivatives which followed the decline in long-term eurozone interest rates during 2023. The settlement payments from derivatives were, in contrast, positive and made an important contribution to financing income of EUR 92.0 million (2022: EUR 5.6 million). As the investment in S IMMO is no longer accounted for at equity, the share of profit/loss from equity-accounted investment amounted to EUR 0.3 million (31 December 2022: EUR -151.9 million due to the final valuation of the equity interest in S IMMO at fair value). Financial results totalled EUR -246.1 million in 2023 (2022: EUR -72.6 million).\n\n#### Net profit\n\nProfit before tax amounted to EUR -313.1 million (2022: EUR 185.7 million), and income taxes equalled EUR 83.7 million (2022: EUR -43.7 million). Included here is deferred tax income of EUR 140.9 million, which resulted primarily from the write-downs recognised to investment property during the reporting period. Net profit for the 2023 financial year totalled EUR -229.5 million (2022: EUR 142.0 million) and represents earnings per share<sup>\\*</sup> of EUR -1.31 (2022: EUR 1.04).\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Balance sheet\n\nThe condensed balance sheet is shown below:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR          | 31 12 2023 | in %  | 31 12 2022 | in %  |\n|------------------------------|------------|-------|------------|-------|\n| Investment property          | 7,830,746  |       | 7,707,196  |       |\n| Property under construction  | 142,960    |       | 198,500    |       |\n| Owner-operated properties    | 229,634    | 87.7  | 231,827    | 87.9  |\n| Real estate inventories      | 4,841      |       | 4,963      |       |\n| Assets held for sale1        | 258,577    |       | 548,484    |       |\n| Other assets                 | 219,207    | 2.3   | 301,867    | 3.1   |\n| Equity-accounted investments | 33,151     | 0.3   | 36,284     | 0.4   |\n| Trade and other receivables  | 233,682    | 2.4   | 208,491    | 2.1   |\n| Cash and cash equivalents    | 697,119    | 7.2   | 652,750    | 6.6   |\n| Assets                       | 9,649,917  | 100.0 | 9,890,362  | 100.0 |\n| Equity                       | 4,563,084  | 47.3  | 4,741,552  | 47.9  |\n| Financial liabilities        | 4,283,531  | 44.4  | 4,167,470  | 42.1  |\n| Trade and other payables     | 289,951    | 3.0   | 256,613    | 2.6   |\n| Other liabilities            | 117,744    | 1.2   | 177,064    | 1.8   |\n| Deferred tax liabilities     | 395,607    | 4.1   | 547,663    | 5.5   |\n| Equity and liabilities       | 9,649,917  | 100.0 | 9,890,362  | 100.0 |\n\n1 Includes investment property as well as other assets that will be transferred to the buyer in the event of a sale.\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group's balance sheet totalled EUR 9.6 billion as of 31 December 2023. Of this total, EUR 8.5 billion, or 87.7%, are attributable to the property portfolio. The decline since year-end 2022 resulted mainly from market-related write-downs and from property sales in line with the strategy. Cash and cash equivalents increased to EUR 697.1 million.\n\nThe owner-operated properties with a carrying amount of EUR 229.6 million (31 December 2022: EUR 231.8 million) represent hotels held by S IMMO. These hotels are owner-operated, for the most part on the basis of management contracts.\n\nWith an equity ratio of 47.3% (31 December 2022: 47.9%) and cash and cash equivalents of EUR 697.1 million, IMMOFINANZ Group has a very solid balance sheet structure.\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-40-0\"></span>EPRA Financial Indicators\n\nIMMOFINANZ is a member of the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA), the interest group for listed real estate companies which is headquartered in Brussels. EPRA's mission is to promote, develop and represent the European public real estate sector. Its objectives are achieved through the provision of better information to investors and stakeholders, active involvement in the public and political debate, improvement of the general operating environment, promotion of best practices, and the cohesion and strengthening of the real estate industry.\n\nWith its Best Practices Recommendations, the EPRA has created a standardised framework for improving the comparability between real estate companies – above and beyond IFRS. IMMOFINANZ Group publishes detailed information on the EPRA indicators based on these recommendations (also see www.epra.com) as part of its commitment to full transparency. The non-financial statement (see Group management report, voluntary consolidated non-financial statement) also provides further non-financial indicators on IMMOFINANZ's performance, including environmental and employee-related issues, in line with the principles and criteria defined in the \"EPRA Sustainability Best Practices Recommendations Guidelines\".\n\n## EPRA net asset value for IMMOFINANZ Group\n\nIn accordance with the EPRA recommendations, IMMOFINANZ Group has published an expanded version of the net asset value indicators (NAV indicators) since the financial statements for 2020. IFRS equity forms the starting point and is adjusted to provide stakeholders with the most transparent information on the market value of the real estate company's assets and liabilities under various scenarios. The EPRA's net tangible assets (NTA) is the most relevant indicator for IMMOFINANZ Group's business activities and, consequently, serves as the primary indicator for net assets. An exact definition of the indicators can be found on the EPRA website (www.epra.com).\n\n|                                                                                                                                                           |  |  | 31 12 2023                    | 31 12 2022                |                          |                               |                           |                          |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|--|-------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|\n| All amounts in TEUR                                                                                                                                       |  |  | Net reinstatement value (NRV) | Net tangible assets (NTA) | Net disposal value (NDV) | Net reinstatement value (NRV) | Net tangible assets (NTA) | Net disposal value (NDV) |\n| IFRS equity excluding non-controlling interests                                                                                                           |  |  | 3,669,797                     | 3,669,797                 | 3,669,797                | 3,790,223                     | 3,790,223                 | 3,790,223                |\n| Diluted equity excluding non-controlling interests after an adjustment for convertible bonds and the exercise of options as well as undisclosed reserves1 |  |  | 3,669,797                     | 3,669,797                 | 3,669,797                | 3,790,223                     | 3,790,223                 | 3,790,223                |\n| Fair value of derivative financial instruments                                                                                                            |  |  | -123,064                      | -123,064                  | -

This decline resulted primarily from the loss recorded for 2023 financial year and reflects the market-related writedowns to investment property. The write-downs to investment property also led to a reduction in deferred taxes. \n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe IFRS book value per share declined by -3.2% to EUR 26.60 (31 December 2022: EUR 27.47).<sup>\\*</sup> \n\n### EPRA earnings per share for IMMOFINANZ Group\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                                                                          | 2023     | 2022     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Weighted average number of shares in 1,000                                                                   | 137,974  | 136,867  |\n| Net profit or loss from continuing operations excluding non-controlling interests                            | -180,316 | 142,601  |\n| Revaluation of investment properties, properties under construction and other effects                        | 372,825  | 121,052  |\n| Results of property sales                                                                                    | 38,328   | -4,624   |\n| Goodwill impairment, negative differences and earn-out effects on purchase price adjustments                 | 174      | -214,323 |\n| Changes in fair value of financial instruments                                                               | 120,880  | -149,933 |\n| Taxes in respect of EPRA adjustments                                                                         | -104,480 | 8,804    |\n| EPRA adjustments in respect of joint ventures and non-controlling interests                                  | -44,961  | -13,268  |\n| EPRA earnings                                                                                                | 202,450  | -109,690 |\n| EPRA earnings per share in EUR                                                                               | 1.47     | -0.80    |\n| Company-specific adjustments                                                                                 |          |          |\n| One-time effects in other operating expenses                                                                 |          | 11,173   |\n| Valuation S IMMO                                                                                             |          | 182,940  |\n| Foreign exchange gains and losses                                                                            | 8,847    | -2,332   |\n| Deferred taxes in respect of company-specific adjustments                                                    | -2,825   | -45,632  |\n| EPRA adjustments in respect of joint ventures and non-controlling interests for company-specific adjustments | -2,742   | 14       |\n| Company-specific adjusted EPRA earnings                                                                      | 205,730  | 36,472   |\n| EPRA earnings per share after company-specific adjustments in EUR                                            | 1.49     | 0.27     |\n\nEPRA earnings per share equalled EUR 1.47 in 2023, compared with EUR -0.80 in the previous year.

2022: 6.5%) and was influenced primarily by property-specific factors (increase in the occupancy rate, especially in Germany and Romania) as well as by the sale of properties. The office portfolio was stable at 11.3%. The retail portfolio was nearly fully rented with a vacancy rate of 1.5%, whereby the STOP SHOP retail parks had the lowest vacancy rate at 1.1%. Additional details can be found in the \"Portfolio report\".\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-45-0\"></span>Risk Report\n\nAs an international real estate investor, property owner and project developer, IMMOFINANZ Group is exposed to a variety of general and branch-specific risks in its business operations. An integrated risk management process provides the Group with a sound basis for the timely identification of potential risks and the assessment of the possible consequences.\n\nRisks represent the possibility of deviating from planned targets as the result of \"coincidental\" disruptions caused by the unpredictable nature of the future. In this connection, negative variances are considered risks in the strict sense of the term and positive variances are seen as opportunities.\n\n### Principles of integrated risk management\n\nThe structure of IMMOFINANZ's risk management is based on the rules of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code and the integrated framework of the COSO ERM<sup>\\*</sup>, an internationally recognised concept for the design of risk management systems.\n\nBased on the hedging and management instruments currently in use, no material risks can be identified at the present time that would endanger the company's standing as a going concern. The overall risk situation for the company and for the entire market in 2023 was influenced by the challenging political and macroeconomic environment. The major risk categories are discussed in greater detail at the end of this risk report.\n\nThe procedures for handling risk are anchored in a Group-wide risk management system which is integrated in operating practices and reporting paths and has a direct influence on processes and strategic decisions. Risk management takes place at all levels through internal guidelines, reporting systems and the internal control system (ICS) which is monitored by the internal audit department.\n\n#### Monitoring and control of the risk management system\n\nThe risk management system is monitored and controlled through two corporate channels. On the one hand, internal audit evaluates the effectiveness of risk management and contributes to its improvement. On the other hand, the auditor reviews the functionality of risk management in accordance with C-Rule 83 of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code (in the version released in January 2023) and reports to the Executive Board on the results of this analysis.\n\n#### Evaluation of the functionality of the risk management system\n\nErnst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H., Vienna, evaluated the effectiveness of IMMOFINANZ's risk management system during the period from December 2023 to February 2024. This analysis covered the design and implementation of the measures and organisational procedures instituted by the company, but not their application in the sense of operating effectiveness. The conclusions by Ernst & Young indicated that the risk management system instituted by IMMOFINANZ as of 31 December 2023 – based on the COSO comprehensive framework for corporate risk management – is functional.\n\n### Structure of risk management\n\nThe goal of risk management at IMMOFINANZ is to implement the strategy defined by the Executive Board with a minimum of risk. The Group's strategic goals are transferred to the operating processes where the measures for the identification, prevention and management of risks are located.\n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Responsibilities and reporting paths\n\n| Supervisory Board                   |                 |           |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------|\n| Executive Board                     |                 |           |\n| Department heads/Country management | Risk management |           |\n| Employees                           | Employees       | Employees |\n\nThe Executive Board is responsible for risk management in the IMMOFINANZ and defines the corporate goals and related risk strategy.\n\nRisk management is a staff function which reports directly to the Executive Board. It monitors the corporate risks that are not related to specific business areas, aggregates risk data and reports, and actively supports the business areas and country organisations in the identification of risks and economically feasible countermeasures. Risk management reports regularly to the Executive Board and quarterly to the Supervisory Board.\n\nAt the country organisation level, the heads of the respective units are responsible for risk management. Risk positions are reported to the Executive Board at least once each quarter by the business area and country managers. Acute risks are reported immediately to the Executive Board.\n\n#### Risk management process\n\nImage /page/46/Figure/7 description: The image shows a flowchart of risk management steps. The first step is \"Risk identification\", which includes basis for risk management and further analyses, selection of segments/business areas to be monitored, and assignment of risks to the relevant level of influence in the organization. The second step is \"Risk assessment\", which includes evaluation of individual risks and their intercorrelation, and classification of risks to create a basis for their management. The third step is \"Risk management\", which includes definition of measures to manage risk, and allocation of risk impact on P&L positions and indicators. The fourth step is \"Risk controlling\", which includes modeling of risks and their impact on results, and regular monitoring of risks, including adjustment of the underlying assumptions.\n\n#### Material risk categories\n\nThe risk categories relevant for IMMOFINANZ follow the company's value chain and are also focused on environmental, governance and social opportunities and risks. IMMOFINANZ has defined a broad range of measures to address and counter risks. These measures represent an integral part of all corporate processes and, consequently, form the basis for the reduction of risk.\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Risk category                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Countermeasures                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Business risks                       | These risks are related to the general framework condi-<br>tions for business activities and exceed the scope of<br>property-specific risks.                                                                                                              | These risks are countered by strategic decisions at the<br>corporate level.                                                                                                                                                      |\n|                                      | Financial risks are related to lenders or the terms and<br>conditions for the provision of cash and cash equivalents<br>(see section 7.2 in the consolidated financial state-<br>ments).                                                                  | The continuous monitoring of asset and liability posi-<br>tions as well as proactive analyses form the basis for<br>strategic measures to safeguard the company's finan-<br>cial strength.                                       |\n|                                      | Operational risk can arise through detrimental actions by<br>corporate bodies and/or employees to the disadvantage<br>of the company.                                                                                                                     | The company's activities are separated into individual<br>processes and relevant process steps are controlled in-<br>ternally.                                                                                                   |\n|                                      | Other risks represent individual risks with a Group-wide<br>impact.                                                                                                                                                                                       | These risks are countered by strategic decisions at the<br>corporate level.                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Risks of improper business practices | IMMOFINANZ is committed to responsible and transpar-<br>ent actions and to compliance with legal rules and regu-<br>lations.

The goal of the ICS is to prevent or identify errors and therefore allow for early correction. The ICS also supports compliance with major legal directives and the business policies defined by the Executive Board.\n\n{48}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe ICS is integrated in all corporate processes. Its key features involve the appropriate segregation of duties, the application of the four-eyes principle within the framework of relevant corporate processes, compliance with internal guidelines (e.g. IMMOFINANZ's IFRS accounting manual), the review of accounting data by Group controlling for correctness, plausibility and completeness, the integration of preventive and detective controls in processes as well as automatic key controls through specific software settings.\n\n#### Monitoring by internal audit\n\nInternal audit is responsible for the independent review of the effectiveness of the ICS and, in this way, contributes to its quality assurance. This department also evaluates the effectiveness of risk management and supports its continuous improvement. Based on an annual audit plan approved by the Supervisory Board, the internal audit department independently and regularly reviews operating processes and business transactions. The priorities for this schedule are defined in accordance with risk criteria and organisational goals.\n\nThe results of the audits are reported to the IMMOFINANZ Executive Board on a regular basis and to the Supervisory Board twice each year. As part of an annual report, the internal audit department explains its activities and summarises the major audit areas and results.\n\n## Opportunity and risk position in 2023\n\n#### Overview of opportunities and risks as of 31 December 2023\n\nImage /page/48/Figure/7 description: The image is a risk management matrix. The y-axis is labeled \"Risk potential\" and the x-axis is labeled \"Impact on value\". The matrix is divided into four quadrants. The top left quadrant is labeled \"Limit risks\" and contains the numbers 1, 2, and 3. The top right quadrant is labeled \"Manage opportunities/risks\" and contains the numbers 4, 6, 7, and 8. The bottom left quadrant is labeled \"Monitor\" and contains the number 5. The bottom right quadrant is labeled \"Utilise opportunities\".\n\nOpportunity potential\n\n#### Macroeconomic conditions (1)\n\nThe 2023 financial year was influenced by an increase in political tensions throughout the world. Armed conflicts resulted in individual cases and were accompanied by a negative impact on raw material markets and the disruption of international trading and logistics routes. The consequence was a further deterioration of the already weakening global economy. At the present time, the expansion of or increase in these conflicts carries the greatest inherent potential for risk. IMMOFINANZ Group is not directly affected by this potential development, but a possible impact on financial and transaction markets or the demand for rental properties cannot be excluded. These developments are the focus of regular monitoring and the best possible hedging of the related risks by IMMOFINANZ Group. Specific components of these risks are discussed in detail in the following paragraphs.\n\n{49}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Financial market risks (2)\n\nThe war in Ukraine triggered a sharp rise in inflation during 2022. The European Central Bank as well as central banks outside the eurozone reacted with a rapid and sizeable increase in interest rates during 2023, which continues to have a strong negative impact on the real estate branch today. On the one hand, this policy shift led to a substantial increase in interest expense for this business sector. IMMOFINANZ Group is continuing its hedging strategy in this context. The hedging-quota for financial liabilities equalled 95.1% at year-end 2023 (31 December 2022: 87.0%). On the other hand, borrowing has become much more difficult for the business sector. The after-effects were bankruptcies by real estate companies across Europe. The changing framework conditions on the capital markets reflected these effects, also in the area of asset allocation – which is discussed in greater detail under the following point.\n\n#### Liquidity risk on the real estate market (3)\n\nThe last few years were characterised by a low-interest policy. The prevailing negative interest rates led to the investment of enormous volumes of capital in real estate due to the lack of viable alternatives. This rising demand supported the construction industry and drove construction to new highs. The demand for properties in good locations frequently exceeded the offering by far. The following sharp rise in interest rates has changed the framework conditions on financial markets, and investors are again able to choose from a larger range of alternatives. Even government bonds have become interesting for institutional investors due to the higher interest rates. The result has been a substantial decline in buyers' interest for real estate. IMMOFINANZ Group reduced its property developments early on and did not start any speculative new construction projects. The current expansion of the STOP SHOP retail parks in Croatia will continue as planned. The completed retail parks are fully rented on opening, and IMMOFINANZ Group therefore views the related risk as manageable. IMMOFINANZ Group is only affected by the decline in transaction volumes to a very limited extent. Its sale programme was announced and launched already in June 2022. IMMOFINANZ Group (including S IMMO) sold properties with a combined value of roughly EUR 751 million in 2023. This programme covered, in particular, the sale of office and residential properties in Germany by S IMMO, as well as the Bureau am Belvedere office building in Vienna, a plot of land in Romania and land in Turkey by IMMOFINANZ. In addition, IMMOFINANZ sold six office properties and a hotel tower with gross rentable space totalling roughly 130,000 sqm to S IMMO. All these measures are part of the focused portfolio strategy that will form the basis for IMMOFINANZ to realise synergies and increase efficiency together with S IMMO.\n\n#### Risks from climate change (4)\n\nThe real estate sector is responsible for roughly one-third of global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Major efforts are therefore directed to reducing this component through new regulations. IMMOFINANZ Group has gone to great lengths in recent years to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from its portfolio. Over the coming years, the company plans to increase its focus on measures to improve energy efficiency. The energy efficiency of buildings – together with energy generation – also plays a central role in the EU Taxonomy Regulation. For this reason, IMMOFINANZ Group has been installing photovoltaic equipment on its properties and plans to continue doing so in the coming years. This important contribution to decarbonisation is an integral part of the company's ESG strategy.\n\nIn the area of climate risks, modelling shows a stronger increase in the temperatures in the IMMOFINANZ Group core markets as well as a greater probability of longer dry periods. Both of these trends are integrated in building refurbishment projects and flow into project development analyses. Properties near the coasts in Poland and Croatia – and here, only a limited number of retail parks are involved – are exposed to the risk of rising sea levels. Natural hazards represent a further aspect since the models forecast an increasing danger of forest fires due to the longer dry periods. This phenomenon is already visible in the Mediterranean region and will spread northward in the coming years. The related risks are addressed with construction measures that include a focus on the design and expansion of green areas and, in addition, all IMMOFINANZ Group properties are insured against natural hazards.\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group also sees opportunities in the area of biodiversity. Future plans include the replacement of water-intensive grassy areas with planting that supports biodiversity. These areas not only save water and energy but require less care and can help to achieve a slight reduction in operating costs.\n\n{50}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Legal proceedings (5)\n\nAs in the previous years, IMMOFINANZ Group is involved in restitution claims related to the VIVO! locations in Cluj and Constanţa. The proceedings related to the VIVO! Cluj resulted in a final judgment that rejected IMMOFINANZ Group's ownership title to the land. For the shopping center itself, all instances to date have confirmed IMMOFINANZ's ownership. In the legal proceedings over the VIVO! Constanţa, witnesses have been called.\n\n#### Valuation risks (6)\n\nThe inflation rates in 2023 were the highest since the early 1970's. Central banks in the IMMOFINANZ Group core countries reacted by raising interest rates which, in turn, has increased the attractiveness of alternative investments as well as investors' expectations of higher returns from real estate. The result has been an increase in yields in nearly all submarkets. These rising expectations are reflected in lower market values and lead to the necessary recognition of write-downs.\n\nAn analysis of the successful transactions in 2023 shows a significant increase in the demand for EU taxonomyaligned properties and properties with a strong focus on ESG aspects. IMMOFINANZ Group is working to bring its entire property portfolio up to taxonomy-aligned standards. The necessary technical measures range from the installation of photovoltaic equipment to thermal refurbishment and the digitalisation of building technology. This will prevent rental risks such as a decline in demand or rentals and counter the loss of value in the standing investment portfolio. As part of its sustainable portfolio strategy, IMMOFINANZ Group wants to create an upward valuation potential for properties with high ESG standards – which will also improve the rental performance of these properties in the coming years.\n\nRevaluation results totalled EUR -376.8 million in 2023.\n\n#### IT risks (7)\n\nDigitalisation is also increasing in the real estate sector. Business processes must be accelerated and become more transparent to meet the growing reporting requirements. In this connection, IMMOFINANZ Group is currently working to upgrade its ERP system. Properties must also become \"smarter\" in the future. Electronic controls help to save energy, reduce emissions and lower operating costs. However, the digitalisation of standing investments is connected with additional costs which require appropriate resources.\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group has taken extensive precautions to protect its IT systems and places high priority on employee training. In addition, corporate processes are being optimised to guarantee the highest possible level of security. Based on the procedures already established, the risk to critical corporate processes can be considered low.\n\n#### Portfolio risks (8)\n\nThe occupancy rate in IMMOFINANZ Group's standing investment portfolio equalled 92.2% as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 92.9%). The retail properties were practically fully rented at 98.7% (31 December 2022: 98.8%). In the office properties, the occupancy rate remained stable at 88.4% (31 December 2022: 88.1%).\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group's active development projects (properties under construction) have a combined carrying amount of EUR 61.5 million (31 December 2022: EUR 126.6 million). The outstanding construction costs for these projects totalled EUR 56.2 million at the end of 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 47.6 million). Pipeline projects, including real estate inventories, had a carrying amount of EUR 195.8 million as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 229.2 million).\n\n{51}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-51-0\"></span>Information on Equity\n\nThe share capital of IMMOFINANZ equalled EUR 138,669,711.00 as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 138,669,711.00) and was divided into 138,669,711 zero par value shares with voting rights, each of which represented a proportional share of EUR 1.00 in share capital.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\n#### Treasury shares held\n\nIMMOFINANZ held 695,585 treasury shares with a proportional share of EUR 695,585.00 in share capital as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 695,585 treasury shares with a proportional share of EUR 695,585.00 in share capital). This holding represented approximately 0.5% of share capital.\n\nNo treasury shares were purchased or sold during the 2023 financial year.\n\n#### Authorisations of the annual general meeting to purchase and sell treasury shares\n\nThe annual general meeting on 3 May 2023 authorised the Executive Board, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to repurchase the company's shares in accordance with § 65 (1) no. 8 and (1a) and (1b) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act at an amount equalling up to 10% of share capital during a period of 30 months. The shares may be purchased over the stock exchange or over the counter.

The subscription rights of shareholders are excluded.\n\nShare capital was conditionally increased by up to EUR 69,334,855.00 through the issue of up to 69,334,855 new bearer shares in accordance with §159 (2) no. 1 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act. The purpose of this conditional capital increase is the issue of shares to the holders of the convertible bonds which were issued in accordance with a resolution of the annual general meeting on 3 May 2023.\n\nThe authorisation for the issue of convertible bonds has not been used to date and is therefore available in full.\n\n## Change of control provisions\n\n#### Corporate bond 2020–2027\n\nThe terms and conditions of the corporate bond 2020–2027 (XS2243564478) issued in October 2020 entitle the bondholders to terminate their bonds and demand immediate repayment at 101% of the nominal value plus accrued interest as of the respective date when a controlling investment (also taking into account the reduced threshold defined by the articles of association) in the company, as defined in the Austrian Takeover Act, is acquired and results in a mandatory takeover offer. Details on these provisions are provided in the issue terms of the bonds.\n\n#### Property financing\n\nThe material property financing agreements concluded by IMMOFINANZ and its subsidiaries generally include standard market cancellation rights for the lenders in the event of a change of control.\n\n#### Corporate credit line\n\nIMMOFINANZ concluded an unsecured, revolving corporate credit line of EUR 100.0 million. It includes a termination right in the event of a change of control. As of 31 December 2023, the corporate credit line had not been used and is therefore available in full.\n\n#### Bonds issued by S IMMO AG\n\nS IMMO is included through full consolidation based on the investment of 50% plus one share held by IMMOFINANZ (for information on full consolidation, also see section 2.3 in the consolidated financial statements). Following is a listing of the bonds issued by S IMMO which include change-of-control clauses that take effect in connection with an indirect change of control at the IMMOFINANZ level.\n\nThe following bonds issued by S IMMO include change-of-control provisions: the 3.25% S IMMO Bond 2015– 2025 issued in April 2015 (volume as of 31 December 2023: EUR 15,890,000.00), the 3.25% S IMMO Bond 2015–2027 issued in April 2015 (volume as of 31 December 2023: EUR 34,199,000.00), the 1.75% S IMMO Bond 2018–2024 (volume as of 31 December 2023: EUR 100,000,000.00) and the 2.875% S IMMO Bond 2018–2030 both issued in February 2018 (volume as of 31 December 2023: EUR 50,000,000.00), the 1.875% S IMMO Bond 2019–2026 issued in May 2019 (volume as of 31 December 2023: EUR 150,000,000.00), the 2.0% S IMMO Bond 2019–2029 issued in October 2019 (volume as of 31 December 2023: EUR 100,000,000.00), the 1.75% S IMMO Green Bond 2021–2028 issued in February 2021 (volume as of 31 December 2023: EUR 70,449,500.00), the 1.25% S IMMO Green Bond 2022– 2027 issued in January 2022 (volume as of 31 December 2023: EUR 25,058,500.00), and the 5.5% S IMMO Green Bond 2023–2028 issued in July 2023 (volume as of 31 December 2023: EUR 75,000,000.00). The terms and conditions of the bonds issued in 2014 and 2015 and the green bonds issued in 2021, 2022 and 2023 entitle the bondholders, in the event of a change of control, to put their bonds and demand immediate repayment. The terms and conditions of the bonds issued in 2018 and 2019 entitle the bondholders, in the event of a change of control, to put their bonds if the change of control materially impairs the ability of S IMMO to meet its obligations under the bond. A change of control as defined in the bond terms and conditions occurs when one or more persons acting in consort, or a third party or persons acting for such a person or persons, at any time, directly or indirectly (i) hold(s) more than 50% of the voting rights connected with the issuer's shares (excluding the maximum voting right) or (ii) has(have) the right to determine the majority of the issuer's management board members and/or shareholder representatives on the issuer's supervisory board. According \n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\nto the terms and conditions of the bonds issued in 2019, a change of control is also assumed to take place when the maximum voting right is legally cancelled and one or more persons acting in consort, or a third party or persons acting for such person or persons, at any time, directly or indirectly, has(have) purchased more than 30% of the voting rights connected with the issuer's shares. According to the terms and conditions of the green bonds issued in 2021, 2022 and 2023, a change of control is also assumed to take place when one or more persons acting in consort, or a third party or persons acting for such person or persons, at any time, directly or indirectly, acquire(s) a controlling interest as defined in the Austrian Takeover Act which triggers a mandatory takeover offer.\n\n#### Executive Board und Supervisory Board\n\nThe Executive Board contracts with Radka Doehring and Pavel Měchura do not include a change-of-control clause.\n\nThere are no such agreements for the members of the Supervisory Board or for employees.\n\nThe company has no other significant agreements which would enter into force, change or terminate in the event of a change of control that results from a takeover bid.\n\n## Amendments to the articles of association, board appointments and dismissals\n\nIn accordance with § 21 of the articles of association, the annual general meeting passes its resolutions based on a simple majority of the votes cast and, for resolutions that require a majority of capital, based on a simple majority of the share capital represented at the time of voting, unless legal regulations require a different majority. The same applies to amendments to the articles of association and to the premature dismissal of members from the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe person chairing the respective meeting casts the deciding vote in the event of a tie in voting on the Supervisory Board in accordance with the articles of association. This also applies to the election to and dismissal of members from the Executive Board.\n\nThe corporate governance report included in this annual report, which was expanded to include the consolidated corporate governance report, is available on the company's website under https://immofinanz.com.\n\n## Significant holdings\n\n–\n\nInformation reported to the company, directors' dealings notifications and other disclosures show the following investments and attributed voting rights which exceeded 4% of share capital as of 31 December 2023:\n\n- Radovan Vitek (via CPI Property Group S.A.): above 75% (based on a holdings notification dated 21 December 2023 and a directors' dealings announcement dated 22 December 2023)\n- Klaus Umek (via Petrus Advisers Investments Fund L.P.): 5.46% (1.06% in shares and 4.40% in financial/other instruments; based on a notification dated 22 December 2023)\n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-54-0\"></span>Setting the course for a future worth living\n\n### Dear reader,\n\nThe operation of buildings is one of the main sources of CO2 emissions worldwide. On the way to climate neutrality, measures to promote energy efficiency and the use of energy from renewable sources are an important lever in reducing climate-damaging emissions. At the same time, the way buildings are designed today must allow their optimal use under changed environmental conditions in the future.\n\nThese considerations were central to the alignment of our sustainability strategy, which we adopted together with CPI Property Group and S IMMO in the past financial year. The Group-wide strategy comprises numerous measures aiming to make the portfolio of IMMOFINANZ Group future-proof and environmentally friendly. We reaffirm our commitment to the Ten Principles of the Global Compact of the United Nations in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. In this report, we are disclosing our continuous progress in integrating the Ten Principles in our business strategy and our everyday operations, thus contributing to the goals of the United Nations and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nWe took effective measures in all ESG areas in 2023. We successfully concluded a power purchase agreement with an Austrian energy company which will supply our Austrian portfolio with electricity from renewable sources in the long term. With this agreement, we are not only pursuing our green electricity strategy, but also protecting ourselves from price fluctuations on the international energy markets. In addition, we continued our ambitious photovoltaics initiative: in 2023 alone, photovoltaic systems with a total capacity of approximately 3,400 KWp were installed at our locations.\n\nIn addition, we adopted a Group-wide standardised Supplier Code of Conduct in 2023 with the intention to raise awareness of sustainable business operations among our partners and suppliers. We are thus taking responsibility beyond the boundaries of our company along the entire supply chain of IMMOFINANZ Group.\n\nESG topics also represented one of the focus areas of our most recent employee survey, which we conducted in autumn 2023. Overall, two thirds of all colleagues participated in the survey. The results serve as important indications for further improvements in terms of workplace quality and sustainability.\n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\nWe are currently working intensively on preparing our reporting for the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which will take effect in the 2024 financial year, and the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). The disclosure obligations stipulated in these frameworks place significant demands on the entire company. We consider this a welcome opportunity to further improve the quality of our nonfinancial reporting.\n\nToday we are setting the course for a future worth living, together with our employees, tenants and business partners. We are convinced that we can make a significant contribution with our measures in terms of sustainability.\n\nBest regards\n\nRadka Doehring Pavel Měchura\n\nPavel Měchura\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\n## General information\n\n#### ESG governance\n\n#### ESG governance structure\n\nThe ESG Committee of IMMOFINANZ is responsible for all sustainability matters, discusses and exchanges information on current projects and conducts regular reviews of progress, relevant opportunities and risks. It also works on continuously embedding sustainability in the Group, as well as on advancing and optimising the sustainability strategy. Within the Group, the Executive Board is responsible for sustainability topics and formally reports to the Supervisory Board at least once a year, while an informal exchange also takes place on a regular basis.\n\nThe ESG staff position has been responsible for the Group-wide coordination and implementation of IMMOFINANZ's sustainability strategy since the beginning of February 2022 and for chairing the cross-functional ESG Committee. This committee is also implementing the development of sustainable supply chain management in the company.\n\nImage /page/56/Figure/6 description: The image shows an organizational chart for an ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) project group. The chart starts with the Supervisory Board at the top, followed by the Executive Board, and then the Head of Group ESG. The Head of Group ESG connects to two roles: Technical Environment and Energy Manager, and ESG Project Manager. Below the Head of Group ESG are three roles labeled E, S, and G. Each of these roles connects to a specific area within the ESG project group. 'E' connects to Science-Based Targets, Energy & Environment, EU Taxonomy, Smart Metering, Climate Risks & Opportunities, and Investor Relations & Reporting. 'S' connects to Sustainable Procurement & Power Purchase Agreements, and Employee Satisfaction. 'G' connects to Ethics & Compliance.\n\n#### S IMMO\n\nAs IMMOFINANZ acquired a majority investment in S IMMO at the end of December 2022, S IMMO is fully consolidated in the 2023 annual report. The figures included in the non-financial reporting therefore comprise the entire IMMOFINANZ Group. In analogy to financial reporting, S IMMO is presented as a stand-alone segment to allow comparability with the previous year.\n\n#### ESG strategy\n\nIn the first half of 2023, IMMOFINANZ, CPI Property Group (CPIPG) and S IMMO standardised their ESG targets. Creating these synergies has further strengthened the joint position, allowing the companies to continue offering tenants optimal property solutions. The ESG targets are now summarised under the categories environmental, social and governance. The reported key indicators and calculation methods were standardised, thus increasing the transparency and soundness of reporting. Where possible, the requirements of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) were already taken into account. A new materiality analysis is scheduled for the 2024 financial year, during which the ESG targets will be challenged and, if necessary, adapted to the results of the analysis and the ESRS requirements.\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\nAccording to the portfolio report, the property portfolio of IMMOFINANZ Group (IMMOFINANZ including S IMMO) comprised 518 properties as of 31 December 2023 with a combined value of EUR 8.2 billion, including 432 standing investments, 15 development projects and 71 pipeline projects including real estate inventories. As in the previous year, properties that are held for sale and fall under IFRS 5 are included in this nonfinancial statement (31 December 2023: EUR 258.6 million; see section 4.10 of the consolidated financial statements of the 2023 annual report for details).\n\nThe goal of IMMOFINANZ is the continuous expansion of a high-quality, sustainable property portfolio generating strong returns, while achieving long-term climate neutrality along the entire value chain in accordance with the targets of the Green Deal of the European Union.\n\n#### Materiality\n\nIMMOFINANZ prioritises ESG topics according to their relevance for and impact on its business activities and its stakeholders. IMMOFINANZ's material topics were adopted for the 2023 financial year based on the materiality analysis of 2020 including the revisions made in 2022. As a result, the following material topics continue to be applicable:\n\n| Key areas                                               | Material topics

Stakeholder engagement\n\nThe core business of IMMOFINANZ comprises the rental and management of office and retail properties, the purchase and sale of properties as well as development projects. Ongoing communication and the acceptance of the business by our various stakeholders are very important to the economic success of our business model. We actively include their views and concerns into the orientation of our business and the further development of our product offering.\n\nIMMOFINANZ views itself as a partner to its stakeholders and is above all committed to its tenants, their customers and employees with the promise of quality and safety. Sustainability aspects are integrated in the planning, construction and operation of our properties in order to meet the needs of our stakeholders.\n\n#### Investors\n\nIn our reporting we want to further increase transparency towards our investors and other stakeholders, who are increasingly interested in climate-related topics. To this end, IMMOFINANZ participated in multiple ESG ratings and rankings in 2023. The company's environmental data was again fully and formally disclosed to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) as part of the consolidated reporting of CPIPG in 2023 and received a \"B\" rating (2022 IMMOFINANZ: D). Moreover, the result of the Sustainalytics rating also improved again compared to the previous year. With a rating of 12.5, the ESG risk was considered to be low, compared with 13.1 and 15.6 in the preceding years (on a scale from 0 to 100).\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Tenants\n\nA special focus in the previous year was on the inclusion of our tenants in the value chain. Regular meetings with our tenants took place throughout the year, during which we presented our ESG strategy and looked for ways of working together. We want to be a reliable partner for our tenants in this context, maintain regular contact in order to learn from each other and thus mutually support each other in decarbonisation.\n\n#### Employees\n\nThe engagement with our employees takes place in both physical and virtual meetings. The myNet intranet is available for internal communication. New policies are communicated to our employees on a regular basis. The year 2023 was characterised by strong change, which was on the one hand due to the challenging economic environment, and on the other hand due to the integration of IMMOFINANZ into the corporate structure of CPIPG.\n\n#### Suppliers\n\nIMMOFINANZ continued to work on improving sustainability along the value chain in 2023. A standardised Supplier Code of Conduct for the entire Group was established, which suppliers are required to sign whenever a contract is concluded or extended.\n\n#### Communities\n\nAlthough the operations of IMMOFINANZ are decentralised, the engagement with the communities takes place at both the local and Group levels. The focus is on a variety of topics and current events. In this context, our local teams worked closely with NGOs and local authorities to provide assistance as fast as possible.\n\n#### Cooperation and initiatives\n\nIMMOFINANZ is a member of numerous associations and institutions such as IG Lebenszyklus or Austrian Council of Shopping Places and thus regularly engages with other companies and organisations.\n\n#### Reporting – international standards and frameworks\n\nIMMOFINANZ adheres to leading international standards in its sustainability reporting. For example, the nonfinancial statement is published in accordance with the standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Universal Standards, see section GRI index). The key indicators reported are also based on the Sustainability Best Practices Recommendations Guidelines (2017) of the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA, see section EPRA index). IMMOFINANZ was awarded as \"Rising Star of the Year\" at the Austrian Financial Communications Awards (AFCA), which places the company in the top 10 of the industry. In addition, several ESRS requirements have already been considered in the key indicators. IMMOFINANZ also meets the legal requirements resulting from the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive.\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### IMMOFINANZ follows leading standards and frameworks\n\n| Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)                | Full annual climate submission to CDP as part of the consolidated reporting of CPI Property Group |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)              | Non-financial reporting in compliance with GRI Universal Standards                                |\n| UN Global Compact                              | Participant in the UN Global Compact committed to the UN SDGs                                     |\n| EU Taxonomy                                    | Reporting meets the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive                                          |\n| Sustainalytics                                 | Further improvement in ESG rating: low risk with an ESG risk rating of 12.5 (scale from 0 to 100) |\n| European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA) | EPRA Sustainability Best Practices Recommendations GOLD                                           |\n\nImage /page/60/Picture/3 description: The image shows four logos.

The third logo is a white square with the words \"SUSTAINALYTICS a Morningstar company\" in black and the word \"RATED\" in gray. The fourth logo is a gold circle with the letters \"EPRA sBPR GOLD\" in white.\n\nIMMOFINANZ's sustainability management is aligned with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations and continuously advances the SDGs falling under its core business. Since 2022, IMMOFINANZ has been committed to the UN Global Compact corporate responsibility initiative and its principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. By signing the UN Global Compact, IMMOFINANZ supports the world's largest sustainability initiative for businesses, thus confirming its social responsibility.\n\nImage /page/60/Picture/5 description: The image shows the logo for the UN Global Compact. The text \"WE SUPPORT\" is at the top of the image. Below the text is a circular logo with the text \"UN GLOBAL COMPACT\" surrounding a globe. Below the globe are two laurel branches.\n\n#### EU Taxonomy\n\nAs part of the voluntary disclosure of the non-financial statement, IMMOFINANZ Group also reports information in accordance with the EU Taxonomy (see section Reporting according to Art. 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation of the European Union\" EU Taxonomy).\n\n#### Local authorities\n\nPolicymakers, especially at the local level, are important partners in the implementation of construction-related measures and development projects. In this area IMMOFINANZ maintains professional contact with all parties involved and aims to take the concerns of the population as well as the respective overall urban development into account.\n\n### Governance\n\n#### Introduction\n\nThe business model of IMMOFINANZ Group is oriented towards long-term, sustainable value creation that is aligned with environmental, economic and social considerations. For further information on this topic, please see the income statement, FFO, personnel expenses and the indicators for employees, economy and society.\n\n{61}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe acceptance of gifts, corruption, bribery, discrimination, and conflicts of interest constitute a reputational risk and a risk of financial damage for IMMOFINANZ. In line with our zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption, several directives are in place to mitigate these risks. There are currently no indications of systematic corruption risks. We encourage awareness raising among employees via regular courses and anti-corruption training.\n\nWe have made a clear commitment to our social and societal responsibility and to respecting human rights through our membership in the UN Global Compact and recognition of its Ten Principles. Therefore, a due diligence process to identify actual and potential human rights abuses along the value chain will be conducted in the future on a regular basis. We consider there to be a low risk in relation to human rights abuses of employees due to the prevailing legal situation in the countries in which IMMOFINANZ operates. Our newly introduced Supplier Code of Conduct, our internal Group procurement directive, which defines the rules and procedures for procurement for IMMOFINANZ, and careful and responsible selection of suppliers help us to further manage the risk of human rights abuses in the supply chain.\n\n#### Governance and ethics\n\nImage /page/61/Picture/4 description: The image contains two icons representing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The first icon, on the left, is for SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. It features the number 8 in white against a maroon background, followed by the text \"DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH\" also in white. Below the text is a white graphic depicting a line graph with an upward trend, symbolizing economic growth. The second icon, on the right, is for SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals. It features the number 17 in white against a dark blue background, followed by the text \"PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE GOALS\" also in white. Below the text is a white graphic consisting of five interconnected circles, symbolizing partnership and collaboration.\n\n#### Governance body\n\nThe Executive Board is responsible for IMMOFINANZ's strategic direction and company performance in relation to sustainability. The Supervisory Board supports and advises the Executive Board. Further details on the composition and working practices of the Strategy and ESG Committee, which was established by the Supervisory Board, are provided in the corporate governance report of the 2023 annual report. This corporate governance report also contains further information on governance diversity KPIs (Gov-Board, Gov-Select, Gov-Col).\n\n#### Business compliance and ethics\n\n| Management approach              |                                                                                     |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Impacts, risks and opportunities | Ensuring compliance with legal and voluntary obligations and<br>principles          |\n|                                  | Potential loss of reputation in case of non-compliance                              |\n|                                  | Potential convictions and fines                                                     |\n| Policies and obligations         | Compliance directives                                                               |\n|                                  | Code of Conduct                                                                     |\n|                                  | Policy statement on respecting human rights                                         |\n|                                  | Supplier Code of Conduct                                                            |\n| Objectives and targets           | Acknowledgement of Code of Conduct by all employees                                 |\n|                                  | Annual mandatory employee training on the Code of Conduct<br>and related directives |\n|                                  | Alignment of Executive Board remuneration to ESG criteria                           |\n| Measures taken                   | Compliance training                                                                 |\n|                                  | Anti-corruption training                                                            |\n| Relevant key indicators          | GRI 207-1 Approach to tax                                                           |\n|                                  | GRI 207-2 Tax governance, control and risk management                               |\n|                                  | GRI 207-3 Stakeholder engagement and management of con-<br>cerns related to tax     |\n|                                  | GRI 207-4 Country-by-country reporting                                              |\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\nIMMOFINANZ employees are familiarised with the principles of the Code of Conduct and the compliance guidelines in regularly held training sessions. During the past financial year, an interactive e-learning course on the handling of insider information was held for employees at the headquarters. The members of the IMMOFINANZ Supervisory Board received in-person training. In addition, all employees and the Executive Board were trained on compliance issues, also via an e-learning tool. This also covered how to recognise and act in the event of possible money laundering activity. In 2023, a Group-wide anti-corruption course was also carried out using an e-learning tool. The members of the IMMOFINANZ Supervisory Board received in-person training also on this topic.\n\nThe IMMOFINANZ Code of Conduct forms the basis for the fulfilment of our responsibility and for all business activities and decisions within the company. This code defines the basic principles and values for responsible corporate governance at IMMOFINANZ. It forms the basis for morally, ethically, and legally sound conduct of all employees of the Group. In particular, the Code of Conduct includes guidelines for respecting fundamental rights, integrity and fairness, for relationships with competitors, customers and associations as well as a ban on discrimination. The active consent to the Code of Conduct of all current employees was obtained.\n\nIMMOFINANZ's high standards were also formally established along the value chain in the 2023 financial year by introducing a Group-wide standardised Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\nIn addition, the Code of Conduct, the anti-corruption and anti-bribery strategy and the strategy against moneylaundering and terrorism funding were updated by the IMMOFINANZ Executive Board. These requirements apply to all employees of the company and Group companies and are communicated to them on a regular basis. The employees are regularly trained on these topics. All Group policies are available to all employees on the intranet.\n\nThe IMMOFINANZ compliance directive covers the legal prohibition on the use of insider information for insider trading and the unlawful disclosure of insider information. In addition to regular training sessions, the compliance officer is available to employees at any time to answer questions.\n\nAdvice on the implementation of the organisation's policies and practices for responsible business conduct can be obtained from the persons responsible in the respective departments. The Corporate Legal Affairs and Compliance departments as well as the Legal department are responsible for monitoring new legislation and requirements in the areas of corporate and operative law.\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Anti-bribery and anti-corruption\n\n| Management approach              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Impacts, risks and opportunities | Ensuring ethical principles<br>Avoidance of financial damage<br>Reputational loss                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Policies and obligations         | Anti-corruption directive<br>Management approach to tax compliance<br>Tax risk management process<br>DAC 6 EU Directive in accordance with the Mandatory Disclosure Regime (MDR)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Objectives and targets           | 100% of the Executive Board and employees trained on ethics, compliance and ESG                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Measures taken                   | Anti-corruption training                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Relevant key indicators          | GRI 205-1 Operations assessed for risks related to corruption<br>GRI 205-2 Communication and training about anti-corruption policies and procedures<br>GRI 205-3 Confirmed incidents of corruption and actions taken<br>GRI 206-1 Legal actions for anti-competitive behaviour, antitrust, and monopoly practices<br>GRI 207-1 Approach to tax<br>GRI 207-2 Tax governance, control and risk management<br>GRI 207-3 Stakeholder engagement and management of concerns related to tax<br>GRI 207-4 Country-by-country reporting<br>GRI 415-1 Political contributions |\n\nIn accordance with the UN Convention against Corruption and the tenth principle of the UN Global Compact, IMMOFINANZ summarises all principles of conduct and requirements for dealing with corruption in its anticorruption directive. The goal of this guideline is to ensure that employees, business partners and customers act in accordance with the law, to prevent conflicts of interest from arising and to protect employees from criminal acts as well as to prevent damage to IMMOFINANZ's reputation due to inappropriate donations. The guideline includes regulations on the acceptance and granting of benefits, donations and sponsoring, the use of intermediaries and the prevention of money laundering.\n\nThe Group-wide anti-corruption course held in 2023 aimed to provide training on principles of conduct and ethical requirements using practical examples and to raise employees' awareness of potential conflicts of interest. It was attended by 100% of the employees and the Executive Board. All members of the Supervisory Board received in-person training. The focus was on the definition of corruption, dealing with public officials and persons from the private environment, gifts and benefits as well as consultants and intermediaries. Anti-corruption training is mandatory for all employees and is held on an annual basis. In addition, employees and other stakeholders can report relevant information or suspicions of corruption confidentially and anonymously via the specially established whistleblower system (https://immofinanz.whistleblowernetwork.net/). No confirmed cases of corruption were reported in the 2023 financial year. There were also no legal proceedings pending due to anti-competitive behaviour or the formation of cartels and monopolies.\n\nThe management approach to tax compliance at IMMOFINANZ is based on a commercially-oriented tax strategy with the overriding goal of complying with applicable tax regulations in all of our countries in a transparent manner. This strategy is monitored by the Executive Board, and significant tax-relevant business transactions must be approved by the Executive Board each time.\n\nIn order to achieve this goal, the IMMOFINANZ internal Tax department is integrated into all business-related processes. The Tax department is staffed with experienced tax experts. Reporting is made directly to the Executive Board and the Tax department is involved in the approval process for relevant business decisions in a standardised manner.\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe tax compliance process includes a four-eyes principle. In addition to internal controls, external advisers are also involved in the review process of tax returns.\n\nIn addition, tax risk reporting is collected quarterly throughout the Group and each individual company is critically analysed in terms of its tax risk level including ongoing reporting of all tax audits and litigation. This tax risk management process is also embedded in the Group-wide risk management function. The tax risk management process was audited in the 2022 financial year by a firm of certified public accountants in the form of a maturity analysis based on the legal requirements of the Austrian tax control system. The audit resulted in a very good assessment of the functioning of the tax risk management system.\n\nThe success of this low-risk approach has been evident in tax audits over the last decade, during which no material findings were identified.\n\nAs part of the ongoing assessment of tax returns, there are regular consultations with the relevant tax offices. In addition to regular telephone consultations, supplementary requests and questions are answered in writing via the tax office's online portal. In all communications with the tax authorities, care is taken to ensure that all questions are answered comprehensively, on time and in full. Care is always taken to ensure professional and respectful cooperation, striving for open communication on tax matters. In case of material tax matters, tax rulings are obtained from the tax authorities. No active political influence is exercised on tax matters. We attach great importance to compliance with tax regulations in all relationships with business partners, employees and other stakeholders.\n\nIn the event that errors are identified during the course of internal controls, comprehensive and timely disclosure is made in the form of corrected tax returns or – if legally required – by means of a voluntary disclosure to avoid penalty.\n\nIn addition to local tax requirements, IMMOFINANZ also carefully observes international reporting requirements. For example, a customised reporting process has been implemented to meet the requirements of the DAC 6 EU Directive in accordance with the Mandatory Disclosure Regime (MDR).\n\nUntil now, country-by-country reporting (CbCR) requirements did not apply to IMMOFINANZ, as the relevant revenue threshold of EUR 750 million was not exceeded. This changed in the 2022 financial year insofar as CPI Property Group acquired a majority shareholding in both IMMOFINANZ and S IMMO, and revenue of the entire Group including IMMOFINANZ now exceeds this revenue threshold. As the ultimate parent company, CPIPG is required to submit the country-by-country report annually for the entire Group. This reporting obligation and the relevant deadlines are met by CPIPG. In addition, each individual Group company is required to submit a report on the identity and domicile of the company subject to the reporting obligation to the local tax authorities. This reporting obligation and the relevant deadlines are met.\n\nIn addition, as in the past, comprehensive transfer price documentation is prepared annually in accordance with OECD principles.\n\nStarting in the 2024 financial year, a separate top-up tax equal to the difference between the global minimum tax rate of 15% and the lower effective tax rate will be imposed in order to bring up the effective tax rate of low-taxed corporate entities to a globally standardised minimum taxation level. This minimum taxation system was adopted as an EU Council Directive in December 2022 and had to be implemented into national law by the individual EU member states by 31 December 2023. The minimum taxation system applies to companies and permanent establishments of all groups with combined annual revenue of more than EUR 750 million. Once these regulations enter into force, every single group company or permanent establishment is required to file a top-up tax information return – even if no top-up tax is incurred for the individual companies or the group as a whole. As the revenue threshold of EUR 750 million will be exceeded, all IMMOFINANZ Group companies are subject to the new minimum taxation system. The Group companies will meet the new obligations of the minimum taxation system and the relevant deadlines.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs shown in the list of Group companies (section 8 of the consolidated financial statements of the 2023 annual report) IMMOFINANZ now has only a very small number of subsidiaries in Cyprus and the Netherlands. These companies were acquired along with the underlying structures during historical portfolio purchases – predominantly before 2008 – and were not for the purpose of tax advantages. Until the point of liquidation, they are being held solely for corporate legal purposes and have no active income (in some cases interest and dividend income). As part of a structural simplification programme that has been underway since 2015, the total number of consolidated companies has already been significantly reduced. The goal is to close all of these holding companies in Cyprus and the Netherlands. All operating income in IMMOFINANZ Group – in particular rental income and capital gains – is generated and taxed exclusively in Austria and in the operating country companies.\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group does not make political donations.\n\n#### Data privacy and data protection\n\n| Management approach              |                                                                                                                    |\n|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Impacts, risks and opportunities | Ensuring that corporate conduct adheres to data protection law                                                     |\n| Policies and obligations         | Protecting the rights of data subjects                                                                             |\n|                                  | Potential data protection violations and financial penalties                                                       |\n|                                  | Data protection directive                                                                                          |\n|                                  | IT directive (data security)                                                                                       |\n|                                  | General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)                                                                          |\n| Objectives and targets           | 100% of employees received training                                                                                |\n| Measures taken                   | Interactive online training on data protection, IT directive and cybersecurity                                     |\n|                                  | Implementation of operational measures for monitoring and reaction to data protection violations and cyber attacks |\n|                                  | Initiative for data classification and risk assessment                                                             |\n| Relevant key indicators          | GRI 418-1 Substantiated complaints concerning breaches of customer privacy and losses of customer data             |\n\nIMMOFINANZ dealt proactively with the increased requirements for the protection of personal data resulting from the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force in May 2018. This regulation not only entails an extensive expansion of the obligations of those responsible and the rights of those affected, but also a very substantial increase in the penalties for data protection violations. Compliance with applicable data protection regulations is therefore essential for IMMOFINANZ and a legal requirement.\n\nThe measures and investments required for compliance with the GDPR were defined and implemented by the Corporate Legal Affairs and Compliance, Legal, and IT departments, together with all business units.\n\nThe data protection directive sets out mandatory requirements for the processing of personal data in accordance with data protection standards and the associated obligations of all IMMOFINANZ employees. Compliance with this guideline is intended to ensure that the company acts in accordance with data protection law, in particular to safeguard data subject rights, define processes for dealing with these data subject rights and avoid financial penalties resulting from data protection violations.\n\nThe IT directive forms the basis for data security as well as responsible and cost-conscious use of the information technology facilities. It also regulates, among other things, access to IT systems, usage of IT resources and smartphones and the procedure for dealing with IT security incidents. The guideline is an integral part of employment contracts.\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\nPart of the organisational measures to protect data and ensure compliance with data privacy law is mandatory training of employees by the data protection coordinator. In the past fiscal year, another interactive online training course was held on the topics of data protection, the IT directive and cybersecurity. In the event of more extensive changes to existing systems or the introduction of new applications, internal and external reviews are also carried out. For the 2023 financial year, IMMOFINANZ is not aware of any substantiated complaints, either from third parties or regulatory authorities, regarding breaches of customer data protection.\n\n#### Risk management\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group has established a Group-wide risk management system. The risk catalogue includes, among others, environmental, social and governance risks. In recent years, IMMOFINANZ Group has placed a special focus on the identification of existing climate risks in the portfolio and their mitigation. These climate risks are identified and analysed by internal and external experts based on annually updated climate models for each location. While the area of natural hazards has already been taken into consideration in the past and IMMOFINANZ Group insures its properties against damage resulting from natural hazards, climate change poses new risks (see section climate risk analysis) that require increased attention for mitigation. The risk position of IMMOFINANZ Group is addressed in detail in the risk report of the 2023 annual report.\n\n## Climate and environment\n\n#### Introduction\n\nThe acute climate crisis and the associated economic and ecological impacts are the most pressing challenges of our time. As one of the leading commercial property groups in Central and Eastern Europe with a property portfolio totalling EUR 8.2 billion, IMMOFINANZ Group is aware of its responsibility. Our stakeholders also place high priority on environmental issues. Sustainable and energy-efficient properties that meet the criteria of the EU Taxonomy will therefore become an even greater focus for tenants in the future – with potential effects on occupancy, rental income and property valuations.\n\nIn the past year, we focused on improving our CO2 footprint and on further developing renewable energy sources. Reducing our greenhouse gas emissions is a key strategic priority in this respect. In 2023, the calculation method for CO2 emissions was standardised across the Group to allow comparability of the key indicators. All environmental indicators for 2022 were also recalculated using the standardised method and considering adjusted assumptions, and are presented in the adjusted tables. These indicators now also include the figures for S IMMO. We want to continue being a reliable partner for our tenants on their path to decarbonisation and drew up a standardised green lease contract for the entire Group in the past year. Implementing this contract is another key milestone in achieving our ESG goals and in continuously improving data quality.\n\nWe are making an important contribution to the fight against climate change with our standardised sustainability strategy within the Group. The target to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of the property portfolio by 32.4% by 2030, which is contained in the strategy and was validated for CPIPG by the Science Based Target Initiative, is in line with the well below 2°C scenario of the Paris Agreement.\n\n#### Climate risk analysis\n\nThe climate crisis poses numerous risks to the business of IMMOFINANZ Group, at both an operational and strategic level. These climate risks can be roughly divided into physical and transition risks. Physical risks include, for example, droughts, floods or severe storms, but also permanent effects such as the rising sea level or increasingly longer periods of heat. Transition risks are risks arising from economic change. For example, some business models will no longer be successful in the future due to new technologies, rising CO2 prices or changes in consumer behaviour.\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\nBased on the four pillars of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and in accordance with the requirements of the EU Taxonomy, climate risk analyses were carried out for all properties of IMMOFINANZ Group in 2022 and 2023.\n\n#### Green & climate resilient buildings\n\nImage /page/67/Picture/3 description: The image shows three Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) icons.

the consistent implementation of our ESG strategy. This strategy includes solid and specific targets and milestones. The main goal is to reduce the intensity of climate-damaging greenhouse gas emissions by 32.4% by 2030 compared to 2019. A reduction of almost 50% was already achieved in the 2023 financial year, meaning that the reduction target of 32.4% from the ESG strategy has already been significantly exceeded. Based on the requirements of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards, ambitious goals are expected for the coming financial years.\n\nIn the reporting year, the 2019 baseline was adjusted using the standardised calculation method, taking into account the changes in the portfolio. In addition, we continuously monitor any structural changes and assess whether these require an additional adjustment of the baseline.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\nBased on a detailed analysis of the landlord and tenant spaces, emissions caused by tenants were allocated to Scope 3, category 13 (Downstream Leased Assets) in the 2022 financial year. In the course of the standardisation of the calculation method within the Group and the full consolidation of S IMMO, these emissions were largely reassigned to Scopes 1 and 2.\n\nThe key levers in reducing IMMOFINANZ's greenhouse gas emissions are the electrification of heating systems and the vehicle fleet, the expansion of photovoltaic systems, and the switch to renewable energy sources, in terms of both the energy purchased by the company and tenants' energy consumption.\n\nThe green lease strategy is one of the measures taken as part of the ESG targets. A green lease is a lease intended to enable both the tenant and the landlord to use or manage a leased property in a way that is as sustainable as possible. The advantages of green leases include cost savings due to lower consumption on the one hand, while contributing to environmental and climate protection through a reduction of emissions and waste on the other; this, in turn, makes the property more attractive for financing or a sale. In the 2023 financial year, the first green lease contracts were already concluded in Austria and other countries.\n\nIn 2023, greenhouse gas emissions are reported for IMMOFINANZ Group for the first time. In 2023 we reduced our greenhouse gas emissions (market-based) by 44.1% in comparison with the 2019 baseline. Due to the full consolidation of S IMMO, the total CO2 equivalent emissions (market-based) of IMMOFINANZ Group amounted to 208,891 tonnes (2022: 242,814 tonnes) in the reporting period, compared to 373,861 tonnes in 2019. IMMOFINANZ Group's greenhouse gas intensity has already been reduced by almost 50% compared to the recalculated 2019 baseline, which means the ESG strategy target has already been significantly exceeded.

The reported CO2 emissions represent gross emissions. The CO2 equivalents for all greenhouse gases from the Kyoto Protocol (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFKW, PFC, SF6 and NF3) were considered in the calculation. Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions include all categories with the exception of 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.12 and 3.14. The areas not included were considered to be immaterial for IMMOFINANZ Group.\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Energy efficiency\n\n| Management approach              |                                                                                                                |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Impacts, risks and opportunities | Creating transparency towards our stakeholders                                                                 |\n|                                  | Lower operating costs due to reduced energy consumption                                                        |\n|                                  | Creating climate-resilient buildings                                                                           |\n|                                  | Higher energy consumption due to extreme weather events, e.g. increased cooling                                |\n| Policies and obligations         | EU Taxonomy                                                                                                    |\n|                                  | Building certifications according to BREEAM, LEED, Access4you, DGNB, EDGE, Green Key, Green Star, HQE and WELL |\n|                                  | Ongoing energy data management                                                                                 |\n|                                  | Local regulations regarding building efficiency                                                                |\n| Objectives and targets           | Reducing energy intensity of the property portfolio by 10% by 2030 compared to the 2019 baseline               |\n|                                  | Digitalisation of consumption data and rollout of smart metering                                               |\n| Measures taken                   | Screening and analysis of energy performance certificates of the entire portfolio                              |\n|                                  | Climate-resilient construction, e.g. architectural features providing shade, green façades                     |\n|                                  | Exchange of cooling systems with heat recovery using refrigerants with limited global warming potential        |\n|                                  | Implementation of structural and technical building optimisations                                              |\n| Relevant key indicators          | GRI 302-1 Energy consumption within the organisation                                                           |\n|                                  | GRI 302-3 Energy intensity                                                                                     |\n|                                  | GRI 302-4 Reduction of energy consumption                                                                      |\n|                                  | CRE 1 Building energy intensity                                                                                |\n|                                  | CRE 8 Sustainability certification                                                                             |\n|                                  | Cert-Tot Type and number of sustainably certified assets                                                       |\n|                                  | EPRA Elec-Abs, Elec-Lfl, DH & C Abs, DH&C Lfl, Fuels-Abs, Fuels-L fl Energy-Int                                |\n\nBuildings are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. IMMOFINANZ Group therefore relies on continuous measures to ensure and improve the energy efficiency and to avoid greenhouse gas emissions of its standing investments as much as possible (GHG, see risk report in the 2023 annual report). With respect to development projects, we are responding to this challenge by an efficient use of resources, ensuring that operations are carbon-neutral and considering potential climate changes at an early stage through climate risk analysis.\n\nContinuous energy management is carried out in cooperation with the property and facility managers. Energy management essentially comprises the regular services in the day-to-day business (e.g. energy controlling), the development of optimisation measures and their implementation. The goal of IMMOFINANZ Group is to continually reduce the use of resources by means of energy-saving measures and responsible energy utilisation while maintaining or improving the quality of building usage. Potential energy saving measures are regularly evaluated and implemented in the process. Examples include the implementation of combined heat and cooling plants at myhive am Wienerberg | Twin Towers, which led to savings of more than 50% in district heating consumption, or upgrading variable volumetric flow controllers to enable demand-oriented ventilation. In addition, refrigerants with high greenhouse gas potential will be replaced.\n\nIn 2023, a pilot project that allows actively accessing the building management system (BMS) by means of autonomous AI algorithms was launched to increase thermal comfort and air quality while at the same time reducing CO2 emissions and operating costs. To this end, weather forecasts, rate structures of utility companies or occupancy density in different areas are taken into account, and the building zones affected are managed in a targeted, autonomous and energy-efficient manner to meet the building users' highest expectations of comfort.\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\nIMMOFINANZ is currently working on digitally and centrally recording all energy consumption data such as electricity, cooling, heating, water or natural gas. The collected data can then be linked nearly in real time, profound and reliable analyses can be made fully automatically and, if necessary, corrective action can be taken to improve energy efficiency and thus further reduce energy costs in the long run. Moreover, future reporting requirements can be met efficiently in this way. In order to examine the technical feasibility and scalability of this project, two pilot projects with more than 80 digital metering points were successfully implemented in the 2023 financial year. In addition, a comprehensive real-time reporting system including data processing and KPI calculation was developed.\n\nDue to the expansion of energy data management in 2022, the degree of coverage of buildings is 100%.\n\nTotal energy consumption amounts to 714,419 MWh (2022: 742,363 MWh) including S IMMO. Energy consumption thus declined by nearly 4% compared to the previous year. Overall, CO2 emissions (market-based) caused by the operation of our properties were reduced by around 44% compared to the 2019 baseline year.\n\nDetails on energy consumption can also be found in the tables on Energy consumption and mix.\n\nDevelopment projects and standing investments in the office and retail segment are to be certified in accordance with environmental standards. For office buildings BREEAM and LEED certifications are used, shopping centers and retail parks should primarily receive a certification according to BREEAM.\n\nAs planned, the proportion of certified space of IMMOFINANZ Group was significantly increased in the past financial year. Additional office buildings in Vienna received BREEAM certifications, version \"In use V6.0\", in the categories \"Good\" to \"Excellent\". With the exception of the Urban Garden building, for which the aim is BREEAM certification of the category \"Outstanding\", all office buildings in Austria have been awarded BREEAM certificates. After the BREEAM certification of another three VIVO! shopping centers and one STOP SHOP in Romania, the entire retail portfolio there has now received green building certificates. In addition, STOP SHOPs in Austria and Croatia were awarded BREEAM certificates for the first time in 2023.\n\nThe certified space of IMMOFINANZ Group at the end of 2023 added up to approximately 1,685,000 sqm or just under 50% of the total lettable area of the standing investment portfolio. The portfolio of IMMOFINANZ accounted for roughly 958,800 sqm (2022: 903,107 sqm) and the portfolio of S IMMO for roughly 726,400 sqm (2022: 496,375 sqm). In relation to the respective total lettable area, 44.7% (IMMOFINANZ 2022: 41.9%) and 51.3% (S IMMO 2022: 34.8%) of the space were certified. The year-on-year increase for IMMOFINANZ amounted to roughly 6.2%.\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Renewable energy\n\n| Management approach              |                                                                                                                           |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Impacts, risks and opportunities | Conversion to renewable energies as an important contribution to the ESG strategy                                         |\n|                                  | Clean and green alternatives to gas are more cost-effective than conventional energy sources in the short and medium term |\n|                                  | Potential reputational damage due to high CO2 emissions among various stakeholders (banks, tenants, investors, etc.)      |\n|                                  | Potential higher CO2 emissions block transformation                                                                       |\n| Policies and obligations         | ESG strategy                                                                                                              |\n|                                  | Phase-out of fossil fuels                                                                                                 |\n| Objectives and targets           | 100% of electricity procurement from renewable energy sources by the end of 2024                                          |\n|                                  | 60% STOP SHOP rooftops equipped with photovoltaic systems by 2030                                                         |\n| Measures taken                   | Installation of photovolatic systems                                                                                      |\n|                                  | Conversion of electricity supply to renewable energy sources                                                              |\n|                                  | Power purchase agreements concluded                                                                                       |\n| Relevant key indicators          | GRI 302-1 Energy consumption within the organisation                                                                      |\n|                                  | GRI 302-3 Energy intensity                                                                                                |\n|                                  | GRI 302-4 Reduction of energy consumption                                                                                 |\n|                                  | CRE 1 Building energy intensity                                                                                           |\n\nIMMOFINANZ is implementing a large-scale programme of measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption in order to meet the targets of its ESG strategy. Therefore, IMMOFINANZ will massively expand its own renewable energy production by installing photovoltaic equipment on the rooftops of its STOP SHOPs and other retail parks. In 2023, our installed photovoltaic systems already produced more than 1,600 MWh of green energy.\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group aims to obtain 100% of the electricity purchased from renewable sources by the end of 2024. This target was already met for Austria in 2023 with the conclusion of a long-term power purchase agreement. IMMOFINANZ is securing the supply of all Austrian standing investments with electricity generated by photovoltaic systems and hydroelectric power from Austria based on an innovative partnership with Stockenboi Energie and ENERGIEALLIANZ Austria. 100% of the electricity comes from renewable energy sources in Austria and ensures predictability over the entire term of the contract for both contractual parties due to the fixed terms and conditions. In addition, a power purchase agreement was concluded for the entire German portfolio of S IMMO.\n\nIn 2023, photovoltaic systems with a capacity of 3.4 MWp were installed in Austria, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Serbia, with the installation of another 9 MWp planned for the current financial year.\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Building circularity and life cycle management\n\n| Management approach              |                                                                                                                                    |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Impacts, risks and opportunities | Use of pollutant-free construction materials to avoid environmental damage                                                         |\n|                                  | Responsible use of resources                                                                                                       |\n|                                  | Loss of value due to insufficient information on materials used                                                                    |\n|                                  | Potentially higher consumption of resources leads to pressure<br>on raw materials and biodiversity as well as higher CO2 emissions |\n|                                  | Potentially higher waste generation with low circularity                                                                           |\n| Policies and obligations         | Standardised building and equipment specifications                                                                                 |\n|                                  | Compliance with minimum requirements of building certifications for new buildings and renovations                                  |\n| Objectives and targets           | Greatest possible avoidance of landfilling, waste recycling rate of<br>55% by the end of 2025, increase rate to 60% by 2030        |\n|                                  | Reduction of water intensity of the property portfolio by 10% by<br>2030 compared to the 2019 base line                            |\n| Measures taken                   | Improvement of data quality                                                                                                        |\n|                                  | Use of cradle-to-cradle products such as carpet tiles                                                                              |\n| Relevant key indicators          | GRI 303-1 Water as a shared resource                                                                                               |\n|                                  | GRI 303-3 Water withdrawal                                                                                                         |\n|                                  | GRI 306-1 Waste generation and significant waste-related impacts                                                                   |\n|                                  | GRI 306-2 Management of significant waste-related impacts                                                                          |\n|                                  | GRI 306-3 Waste generated                                                                                                          |\n|                                  | GRI 306-4 Waste diverted from disposal                                                                                             |\n|                                  | GRI 306-5 Waste directed to disposal                                                                                               |\n|                                  | CRE 2 Building water intensity                                                                                                     |\n|                                  | EPRA Water-Abs, Water-I fl, Water-Int, Waste-Abs, Waste-I fl                                                                       |\n\nUsage of construction materials containing harmful substances during development projects or refurbishments can have a negative impact on the environment. IMMOFINANZ takes precautions to ensure sustainable construction and careful selection of its business partners through highly standardised building and equipment specifications. In 2023, for example, all newly built mycowork spaces throughout the Group were furnished with cradle-to-cradle carpet tiles. The cradle-to-cradle principle describes a closed cycle of raw materials based on the model of nature, where all raw materials of a product remain in the cycle after the usage period and can be reused. When developing office space, we rely on system partition walls for tenant fit-out which can be moved according to tenants' needs. This way, no waste is created when conventional (e.g. plasterboard) partitioning walls are taken down or reinstalled.\n\nMeasurable targets for waste generation have been defined as a new objective in the standardised ESG strategy of IMMOFINANZ, S IMMO and CPIPG. Avoiding landfilling to the greatest extent possible based on a recycling rate of 55% by the end of 2025, and increasing this rate to 60% by 2030 will make a significant contribution in this context. In 2023, the share of recycled waste in the total portfolio including S IMMO amounted to 37.6% (2022:39.2%). The slight decrease is due to improved data quality. The waste generated in the reporting area of IMMOFINANZ Group primarily consisted of municipal waste and similar commercial waste as well as recyclables (glass, metals, plastics, paper and cardboard).\n\nWe have also set a quantifiable target for water consumption. Although own consumption of water and energy and the environmental impact resulting from the operation of its own office locations constitute only a small proportion of the total portfolio, IMMOFINANZ Group nevertheless aims to further minimise its water consumption. Specifically, the target is to reduce the water intensity of our portfolio by 10% by 2030 compared with the 2019 baseline. Water consumption amounted to 1,995,231 m3 (including S IMMO) in 2023 (2022: 2,019,897 m<sup>3</sup>). Of this total, 423,640 m<sup>3</sup> of water was sourced from areas with water scarcity in Germany, Romania and Serbia. For the definition of areas with water scarcity, the climate risk analyses for the respective locations were used.\n\n{73}------------------------------------------------\n\n76% of the water used comes from municipal sources. The remaining share is attributable to groundwater withdrawal and rainwater harvesting. Here, the largest part is accounted for by the withdrawal of groundwater for cooling purposes at a location in Germany, all of which is returned to groundwater.\n\n#### Green mobility\n\n| Management approach              |                                                                                                                        |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Impacts, risks and opportunities | Enabling the transformation towards green mobility through in-<br>stallation of e-charging stations                    |\n|                                  | Pioneering role regarding the trend towards e-mobility, expan-<br>sion of infrastructure to the extent of future needs |\n|                                  | Lack of attractiveness of locations due to lack of e-mobility of-<br>fers                                              |\n| Policies and obligations         | Car policy with incentive to use e-mobility                                                                            |\n| Objectives and targets           | Creation of relevant infrastructure to enable conversion to envi-<br>ronmentally friendly mobility                     |\n| Measures taken                   | Installation of e-charging stations                                                                                    |\n| Relevant key indicators          | Number of charging stations                                                                                            |\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group supports the transformation towards e-mobility and the use of renewable energies and aims to play a pioneering role in providing the necessary infrastructure for this. The goal is therefore to continuously expand the number of charging stations for electric vehicles, with 729 charging stations already available at the Group's locations at the end of 2023. This way, we want to contribute to CO2 reduction, while ensuring that properties of IMMOFINANZ Group remain preferred places for shopping and working given the increasing trend towards e-mobility.\n\nIn 2023, e-charging stations were commissioned in two parking garages at the myhive am Wienerberg location. A total of 39 new charging points are available exclusively to office tenants and their employees. Thanks to shared use of the infrastructure (without allocation of parking spaces), utilisation is expected to be higher than would be the case for reserved parking spaces. Optimal use of the infrastructure is therefore ensured. As no high one-off costs arise for the users of the e-charging zones, easy access to e-mobility is also facilitated for small and medium-sized companies.\n\n{74}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Biodiversity and responsible land use\n\n| Management approach              |                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Impacts, risks and opportunities | Responsible management of soil sealing due to construction activity                                                                                                   |\n|                                  | Measures to preserve biodiversity                                                                                                                                     |\n|                                  | Minimisation of impact and compensation measures                                                                                                                      |\n|                                  | Recultivation and improvement of biodiversity                                                                                                                         |\n|                                  | Non-compliance leads to vulnerable ecosystems, pressure on bi- odiversity remains high                                                                                |\n|                                  | Clean environment depends on biodiversity                                                                                                                             |\n| Policies and obligations         | EU Taxonomy                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Objectives and targets           | Support of local ecosystems by transforming the environment of properties                                                                                             |\n| Measures taken                   | Urban forest project based on the Miyawaki afforestation method                                                                                                       |\n|                                  | Implementation of the myhive Urban Garden office project                                                                                                              |\n|                                  | Keeping bee colonies                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Relevant key indicators          | GRI 304-1 Operational sites owned, leased, managed in, or adja- cent to, protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value out- side protected areas               |\n|                                  | GRI 304-2 Significant impacts of activities, products, and ser- vices on biodiversity                                                                                 |\n|                                  | GRI 304-3 Habitats protected or restored                                                                                                                              |\n|                                  | GRI 304-4 IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Red List species and national conservation list species with habitats in areas affected by operations |\n\nIn its risk report for 2024, the World Economic Forum ranks global risks by their short and long-term severity. According to the report, biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse consequently represent the third largest risk for our planet over a timeframe of ten years. IMMOFINANZ Group contributes to reducing the risk and has already taken first measures.\n\nOne example in this area is the myhive Urban Garden office project in Vienna, which was completed in September 2023. For this project, an existing building with a total area of approximately 17,600 sqm was extensively refurbished. It features several green spaces as well as state-of-the-art and energy-efficient technology. Green façades, roofs and terrace landscapes provide a feel-good atmosphere and an attractive microclimate for tenants. In addition, tenants commit to responsible energy consumption and the greatest possible waste avoidance through green lease contracts. The entire energy demand of the property is covered by 100% green electricity from renewable sources. Facilities also include public e-charging stations and a mobility concept offering the option to use e-scooters and e-bikes. The project is currently undergoing the certification process to obtain a BREEAM certification in the category \"Outstanding\".\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/75/Picture/1 description: This is an eye-level, long shot of the \"myhive\" building, which is a modern, multi-story structure with a combination of stone and glass facade. The building has a unique feature of vertical gardens integrated into its design. The sky is clear and blue, suggesting a sunny day. The building is surrounded by greenery, including trees and shrubs, which adds to the urban landscape. The building's architecture is modern and sleek, with clean lines and a combination of materials. The vertical gardens add a touch of nature to the urban environment, creating a visually appealing contrast. The overall composition of the image is well-balanced, with the building as the main subject and the surrounding greenery providing a natural frame.\n\nIn cooperation with local beekeepers, IMMOFINANZ Group has been placing beehives on the rooftops of its properties for several years now to support biodiversity and the enrichment of local ecosystems. The tenants can then enjoy the harvested honey.\n\nAfter the successful test pilot project for an urban forest based on the Miyawaki afforestation method at STOP SHOP Lazarevac in Serbia, another three of these small urban forests were realised at the locations in Sremska Mitrovica, Vršac and Subotica. In this project, the trees are planted closely together so that they only receive sunlight from above and therefore grow upwards more strongly than outwards. In addition to creating small urban forests for the population, the main targets are the preservation of biodiversity as well as the improvement of air quality and the increase of the water holding capacity of the soil.\n\n## Social\n\n#### Introduction\n\nOur society is faced with multiple crises, including the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis, climate change, extreme weather events, as well as supply chain disruptions and ongoing inflation. These multiple crises and the complex challenges they present have a strong impact on the economy and require a high level of adaptability. Cost of living crisis and natural disasters and extreme weather events are classified as the highest risks for the next two years in the 2023 risk report of the World Economic Forum.\n\nIn times like this, IMMOFINANZ Group wants to remain a reliable partner and employer and make a sustainable contribution to customer and employee satisfaction. IMMOFINANZ has a number of ways to contribute to a more sustainable world. On the customer side, we achieve this via a high level of customer orientation and the creation of socially sustainable spaces. We offer our employees numerous opportunities for professional and personal development and see benefits such as workplace health promotion or flexible working models as a matter of course. We also play our part in society and work continuously to increase the standards along our value chain in terms of sustainability and transparency.\n\n{76}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Socially sustainable spaces & customer centricity\n\nImage /page/76/Picture/2 description: The image shows three Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) icons.

Below the text is a white line graph resembling a heartbeat, with a heart symbol at the end. The background of this icon is green. The second icon, in the center, is for SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. It has the number 11 at the top left, followed by the text \"SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND COMMUNITIES\" in smaller font. Below the text is a white illustration of city buildings and a house. The background of this icon is orange. The third icon, on the right, is for SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals. It has the number 17 at the top left, followed by the text \"PARTNERSHIPS FOR THE GOALS\" in smaller font.

We help potential tenants to explore their individual needs in terms of space and facilities. Existing tenants are supported on a day-to-day basis by property and facility managers in all property-specific matters. We are also continuously working to further increase customer satisfaction and user experience through digitalisation measures.\n\nIn addition to individual discussions with tenants, regular tenant surveys have been conducted for several years to evaluate customer satisfaction in the office sector. Site-specific optimisation measures, such as those based on a survey on the gastronomic offerings at the myhive Wienerberg location, are derived from the results. Suggestions and requests from various tenant surveys have also been incorporated into the design of new product offerings, such as the increased flexibility at myhive. In addition, community managers act as a central interface for the wishes and suggestions of tenants and their employees.\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the retail area, tenant satisfaction is also regularly analysed using different types of survey methods. On the one hand, regular meetings with our tenants take place in order to evaluate past and future cooperation. On the other hand, we also conduct structured tenant surveys in the retail area as needed. In addition, our center management teams in the shopping centers serve as points of contact for all tenant concerns. Moreover, a marketing and event plan is developed annually in collaboration with the tenants to ensure that activities and initiatives in which tenants can participate take place on a regular basis. If an office property is located next to a retail property, the office employees will receive special discounts for shopping and the food court.\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group is responsible for compliance with construction and safety regulations to protect building users and the neighbourhood. We therefore aim to ensure a safe environment for tenants and other users of our property portfolio, to prevent potential safety hazards and, if the need arises, to identify and eliminate them in good time – all in accordance with the applicable legislative framework as well as relevant standards and policies. This applies, for example, to all safety-specific aspects relating to fire protection, safety and well-being of people and the environment, and organisational safety measures. Our properties are constructed and operated in accordance with the applicable legal provisions and adapted where necessary to new legal requirements.\n\n#### Socially sustainable spaces\n\n#### Management approach Impacts, risks and opportunities Climate change Soil sealing Lack of social interaction reduces sense of belonging and participation Neglect of social activities can lead to reduced performance Policies and obligations Green lease strategy Objectives and targets Group-wide standardised green lease contracts for all new commercial leases and extensions Development of criteria for sustainable and healthy spaces by 2024 Increase in the share of certified buildings Building a tenant community Measures taken Rollout and green lease pilot project in 2023 Achievement of top building certifications and recertifications Relevant key indicators GRI 203-1 Infrastructure investments and services supported\n\nAn important element of IMMOFINANZ Group's ESG strategy is the introduction and implementation of the green lease strategy in our portfolio. As part of this process a Group-wide standardised model green lease contract has been developed and rolled out to the entire portfolio of IMMOFINANZ Group. In accordance with the green lease strategy, all tenants are called upon to apply this model contract. As of 31 December 2023, green lease contracts had already been signed in five different countries.\n\nThe myhive offices score points with a feel-good atmosphere in the common areas, numerous services and the best infrastructure. They offer space for communicative and lively interaction between tenants and their employees, for example in attractive communication zones and tenant lounges, and during regular events such as after-work events, business breakfasts with expert lectures or the organisation of sports activities.\n\nParticular importance is attached to networking among tenants. Dedicated community managers are the central point of contact for tenants and their employees. They take care of the exchange among tenants, identify opportunities for cooperation, arrange appropriate contacts and organise events. The cross-border myhive app provides information about all news in the respective office building and the myhive community, facilitates communication with experts from other companies at the location and supports central services provided by IMMOFINANZ, for example through a direct feedback tool. This makes it possible to communicate registrations for events, suggestions and requests or damage reports quickly and easily.\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe use of social media has also been continuously expanded. Currently, almost 4,200 users use the myhive app and the number of followers on social media (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn) totals more than 860,000.\n\n#### Socially sustainable workplaces & employee satisfaction\n\nImage /page/78/Picture/3 description: The image shows three Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) icons. The first icon, on a green background, represents SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being. It features a white line graph resembling a heartbeat, with a white heart at the end. The second icon, on a red background, represents SDG 5: Gender Equality. It features a white gender symbol with an equal sign in the middle. The third icon, on a maroon background, represents SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. It features a white bar graph with an upward-pointing arrow.\n\nWe are committed to creating an inclusive working environment in the Group, characterised by openness and mutual respect where every employee feels valued and heard. The focus is on our attractiveness as an employer and on employee retention. Derived from this, employee development and satisfaction, our social commitment as well as diversity, equal opportunities and inclusion are material topics in this focus area.\n\nAfter the majority takeover of IMMOFINANZ by CPIPG, the work on optimising the structure in Austria continued throughout 2023.\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group had 237 employees in 2023, with 137 of them working for IMMOFINANZ and 100 for S IMMO (2022: IMMOFINANZ Group: 300, IMMOFINANZ: 170, S IMMO: 130). The decline in the number of employees is largely due to the takeover of the IMMOFINANZ country organisations by CPIPG. The package of measures of IMMOFINANZ agreed with the Works Council in 20022 to prevent, eliminate and mitigate the implications of the restructuring was extended for 2023. This package includes, in particular, voluntary severance payments and one-off payments and is designed to mitigate potential negative economic consequences for employees. It was applied to individual employees in Austria.\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, two persons worked for S IMMO who are not employees.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Employee development\n\n| Management approach              |                                                                                                                 |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Impacts, risks and opportunities | Supporting employees in their current and future roles                                                          |\n|                                  | Ensuring competitiveness                                                                                        |\n|                                  | High engagement and motivation of employees                                                                     |\n|                                  | Talent management                                                                                               |\n|                                  | Potential increase in costs for recruiting                                                                      |\n|                                  | Potential lack of innovative strength                                                                           |\n|                                  | Potential increase in turnover rate                                                                             |\n| Policies and obligations         | Performance management                                                                                          |\n|                                  | Performance review of employees                                                                                 |\n|                                  | Training and development programmes                                                                             |\n| Objectives and targets           | Empowering employees to be successful in their current and future roles based on career and succession planning |\n|                                  | At least eight hours of training per employee per year                                                          |\n| Measures taken                   | Apprenticeship programmes                                                                                       |\n|                                  | Individual coaching                                                                                             |\n| Relevant key indicators          | GRI 404-1 Average hours of training per year and employee                                                       |\n|                                  | GRI 404-2 Programmes for upgrading employee skills and transition assistance programmes                         |\n|                                  | GRI 404-3 Percentage of employees receiving regular performance and career development reviews                  |\n|                                  | GRI 401-1 New employee hires and employee turnover                                                              |\n|                                  | GRI 401-2 Benefits provided to full-time employees that are not provided to temporary or part-time employees    |\n|                                  | GRI 401-3 Parental leave                                                                                        |\n|                                  | EPRA Emp-Training, Emp-Dev                                                                                      |\n\nIMMOFINANZ strives to create a framework for its employees in which they can develop their potential, strengths and competencies to the best of their abilities. We lead our employees in a trusting manner and place great value on open and respectful interaction with each other. The People & Culture department is responsible for strategic personnel development and further development of the corporate culture in close cooperation with the Executive Board, which discusses current company developments with the Works Council at least once a month.\n\nIn connection with employee development, the focus of training is on expanding professional as well as personal and leadership skills. An important instrument in the context of performance management is the annual performance review between employees and their managers. This defines clear targets and individual training activities. As in previous financial years, performance reviews were conducted with 100% of employees of IMMOFINANZ in 2023. These interviews also include feedback from employees on several questions relating to personal well-being, further development and teamwork as well as suggestions for improvement.\n\n#### Employee development\n\nDeveloping strong leaders and appropriately trained and motivated employees is essential to overcome the complex and multifaceted challenges arising from the current multiple crises and to develop the necessary skills to address them effectively. IMMOFINANZ supports its employees by providing appropriate methods and tools. In coordination with their managers, employees can participate in individual training and coaching (especially for leaders). Finally, employees can also participate in conferences as part of this offering.\n\nLanguage courses as well as various types of individual and group training are offered on a regular basis and taken advantage of by employees.\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the 2023 financial year, around 3,221 hours of training were completed by the employees of IMMOFINANZ Group (thereof IMMOFINANZ 2,216, S IMMO 1,005, 2022: IMMOFINANZ 2,630, S IMMO not disclosed), equivalent to 13.6 hours per employee (IMMOFINANZ 16.2, S IMMO 10.1, 2022: IMMOFINANZ 16.2, S IMMO not disclosed) and thus significantly exceeding the Group-wide target of eight hours per employee. The largest share of training hours was accounted for by compliance training, followed by external training and language courses. The majority of the training courses were held in Austria.\n\n#### Diversity, equality and inclusion\n\n| Management approach              |                                                                                                                 |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Impacts, risks and opportunities | Cultural diversity                                                                                              |\n|                                  | Strengthening innovative power and ability to find solutions<br>based on diverse teams                          |\n|                                  | Increased productivity and motivation                                                                           |\n|                                  | Strengthening team spirit                                                                                       |\n|                                  | Promotion of equal opportunities                                                                                |\n|                                  | Prevention of social discrimination                                                                             |\n| Policies and obligations         | Code of Conduct                                                                                                 |\n| Objectives and targets           | Share of female managers at least 33%                                                                           |\n|                                  | Ensure gender and national diversity in the entire organisation at<br>Group and local level                     |\n| Measures taken                   | Analysis of gender pay ratios                                                                                   |\n| Relevant key indicators          | GRI 401-2 Benefits provided to full-time employees that are not<br>provided to temporary or part-time employees |\n|                                  | GRI 401-3 Parental leave                                                                                        |\n|                                  | GRI 405-1 Diversity of governance bodies and employees                                                          |\n|                                  | GRI 405-2 Ratio of basic salary and remuneration of women to<br>men                                             |\n|                                  | GRI 406-1 Incidents of discrimination and corrective actions taken                                              |\n|                                  | EPRA Diversity-Emp, Diversity-Pay                                                                               |\n\nAt IMMOFINANZ, we firmly believe that a diverse and inclusive work environment benefits not only our employees but also our company. By valuing and embracing the unique perspectives and backgrounds of our team members, which is established in our Code of Conduct, we foster a culture of engagement and open communication. We know that our employees are more likely to work innovatively and share their ideas when they feel valued and included. In this way, they contribute to the growth and success of our company. Therefore, diversity characteristics, especially with regard to age, gender, national or ethnic origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability and educational and professional background are very important to us as an employer.\n\nAt the end of December 2023, six persons with a non-temporary physical, mental or psychological impairment or an impairment of the sensory functions were employed at S IMMO.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, 16 different nationalities were represented among the employees of IMMOFINANZ. The average age was 38.2 years at IMMOFINANZ and 44.1 years at S IMMO (IMMOFINANZ and S IMMO 2022: 37.7 and 44.4, respectively). The share of women in management positions reporting directly to the Executive Board was 23% (2022: 40%). The decline is mainly due to the transfer of female managers to CPIPG. The share of women in all management positions at IMMOFINANZ Group was 33%. The target was therefore met. Women account for 67% (2022: 66%) of non-management positions at IMMOFINANZ. After the gender pay ratio was reported for the first time throughout the Group for the 2020 financial year, analyses and adaptations were made in the following years. As a result, the gender pay gap has already been significantly reduced for both managers and non-managers. The indicator represents the ratio of the total average remuneration of female employees (per category of employee). It is analysed regularly, and further equalisation is being worked on.\n\n{81}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn the past years, a wrong figure was reported for the total gender pay gap due to a transfer error. In the following table the figure for 2022 has already been corrected.\n\n#### Gender pay ratio\n\n|                                  | 2023             |        | 2022              |        |\n|----------------------------------|------------------|--------|-------------------|--------|\n|                                  | IMMOFINANZ Group | S IMMO | IMMOFINANZ Group1 | S IMMO |\n| Total gender pay gap             | 1.39             | 1.42   | 1.57              | n. a.  |\n| Breakdown by employee category   |                  |        |                   |        |\n| thereof top management           | 1.38             | n. a.  | 1.05              | n. a.  |\n| thereof middle management        | 1.13             | 1.17   | 1.18              | n. a.  |\n| thereof entry-level management   | 1.16             | n. a.  | 1.13              | n. a.  |\n| thereof non-management level     | 1.16             | 1.23   | 1.32              | n. a.  |\n| Annual total remuneration ratio2 | 18.00            | 18.38  | n. a.             | n. a.  |\n\n1 2022 only includes the data for IMMOFINANZ.\n\n<sup>2</sup> Annual total remuneration of the highest-paid person of the company (Executive Board member) divided by the median annual total remuneration of the employees \n(without the highest-paid person).\n\nIn the event of questions or potential conflicts, the Group Compliance Officer serves as an independent and confidential point of contact. In 2023, there were no known cases of discrimination including harassment due to ethnic origin or nationality, language, social origin, age, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, political or other beliefs, mental or physical ability or others.

This strengthens the well-being and health of our employees.\n\nAs a real estate manager and developer, IMMOFINANZ's business is largely office-based and therefore has a comparatively low risk of occupational accidents. Health management therefore focuses on preventive healthcare and the promotion of sports activities.\n\n{82}------------------------------------------------\n\nIMMOFINANZ employees are offered flexible and partially flexible working hours, as well as part-time working models. In addition, a remote working policy was adopted in 2022, which allows our employees to also work outside the office. This allows them to better balance full-time employment and personal needs, which increases satisfaction and performance as well as the attractiveness of IMMOFINANZ as an employer.\n\nIMMOFINANZ supports its employees with a variety of offerings outside of the workplace, with team building and promotion of work-life balance being at the forefront. These include, for example, a sixth week of vacation time after three years of service, sports options via the myclubs app and participation in the Vienna City Marathon.\n\nTo support our employees' healthcare needs, we offer a preventive healthcare scheme. In addition to measures meeting all legal requirements, responsibilities include carrying out vaccinations, medical check-ups, eye tests and providing advice on preventive healthcare. In the 2023 financial year, the absence rate due to sickness at IMMOFINANZ declined slightly to 3.4% (2022: 3.9% at IMMOFINANZ).\n\nAll employees of IMMOFINANZ Group are insured against loss of income due to illness, unemployment, occupational accidents as well as incapacity for work, parental leave and retirement in accordance with the respective local legal requirements.\n\nIn addition to health care, IMMOFINANZ offers other company benefits. No distinction is made between fulltime and part-time employees. For example, all employees can choose between an endowment and death insurance. The Executive Board is also entitled to disability and invalidity insurance as well as a retirement pension. Other company benefits, such as share participation, are not offered.\n\nAn employee survey on the topic of \"psychological stress at the workplace\" was conducted in cooperation with the Occupational Safety Center Linz in 2023. The survey was carried out online and anonymously. The results were analysed in the fourth quarter and presented to the Executive Board. It is planned to inform all employees about the results in the course of the second quarter of 2024; in addition, workshops will be held to work on improvements for those areas which scored below the industry average according to the analysis.\n\nHealth and safety inspections are conducted at IMMOFINANZ's own office locations at least once a year by the safety officer, the company physician, the Works Council and the head of People & Culture. Occupational safety risks are evaluated and compliance with statutory workplace and safety regulations is checked. Together with the head of the People & Culture department and the Executive Board, the inspection results are evaluated in a meeting and measures for improvement are decided. In addition to the annual meeting, IMMOFINANZ has specially trained employees who serve as safety officers and can address any issues as they arise. Employees are also trained in first aid and as evacuation/fire protection officers.\n\nAll employees of IMMOFINANZ Group are covered by the respective local occupational and safety regulations.\n\nCollective agreements apply to 67.1% of the employees of IMMOFINANZ Group. Within IMMOFINANZ, the share is 84.7% (2022: 88.8%), at S IMMO it is 39% (2022: 35.4%). 100% of the IMMOFINANZ Group employment contracts in Austria are governed by the collective agreement for salaried employees in property management companies resp. employees in industry. For employees not covered by the tariff, salary schemes customary within the country and industry apply so that all employees of IMMOFINANZ Group receive adequate remuneration.\n\nIMMOFINANZ has also entered into a number of agreements with the Works Council, which are based on social partnership and are designed to improve the position of employees.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition, our Code of Conduct includes a commitment to respect employees' rights to freedom of association. We strive for and maintain a long-term and constructive dialogue with employee representatives.\n\nIn 2023, the number of employees leaving the company was higher than in the previous year. The current employee turnover rate at IMMOFINANZ Group is 34.8%; viewed separately it is 37.4% (IMMOFINANZ) and 31.0% (S IMMO, 2022: 21.6% IMMOFINANZ and 14.0% S IMMO). This is mainly due to the Group-wide restructuring and a change in the calculation method. The calculation logic was adjusted in coordination with CPIPG and S IMMO.\n\nThe average employment with the company was 6.6 years and 8.0 years, respectively, in 2023 (IMMOFINANZ and S IMMO 2022: 5.7 and 7.1 years respectively).\n\n#### Community investment\n\n| Management approach              |                                                                                                      |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Impacts, risks and opportunities | Social commitment as corporate responsibility                                                        |\n|                                  | Promotion of charitable work                                                                         |\n|                                  | Part of corporate culture                                                                            |\n|                                  | Creating value for the company and its communities in the medium and long term                       |\n| Policies and obligations         | Development of a Community Investment Strategy and Guideline by 2023                                 |\n| Objectives and targets           | Definition of IMMOFINANZ's core themes for community investment                                      |\n| Measures taken                   | Projects and partnerships with non-profit organisations                                              |\n| Relevant key indicators          | GRI 413-1 Operations with local community engagement, impact assessments, and development programmes |\n\nAs part of its social commitment, IMMOFINANZ aims to provide support not only financially but also through the diverse resources and competencies of the company and its employees. In this way, sustainable benefits can be created for our different stakeholders. Through our social commitment, we would also like to encourage employee engagement, thus strengthening employee loyalty.\n\nEngagement with our communities, i.e. all those people who work and shop at our properties or live in the neighbourhood, plays an important role for IMMOFINANZ. We always aim to view our properties in the context of their surroundings and people living there. The integration of a property into its immediate surroundings and the quality of implementing this integration increase the value of the respective premises and thus of the individual property.\n\nIn addition to the physical and online events for our tenants described above, we regularly launch initiatives for our communities, including blood donation campaigns or clothing collections for people in need.\n\nEvery year, as part of a Christmas campaign, IMMOFINANZ supports charitable projects and associations both in Austria and in other countries in which we operate. This year's donations of EUR 20,000 each went to St. Anna Children's Hospital and the children's hospice \"Netz\" in Vienna. In addition, the myhive community participated in the Christmas campaign of Caritas. 40 letters with Christmas wishes from children and adults from Caritas houses were received and handed over in person at the respective locations by the team of the myhive Community & Operations Managements.\n\nWe are working on developing further key performance indicators related to our engagement with society and will integrate them into our reporting in accordance with our comprehensive ESG strategy in the future.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Sustainable supply chain\n\nImage /page/84/Picture/2 description: The image is a square icon with a gold background. The number \"12\" is in the upper left corner, and the words \"RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION\" are in the upper right corner. Below the text is a white infinity symbol with an arrow pointing to the left.\n\nManagement approach\n\n#### Impacts, risks and opportunities Ensuring compliance with social and environmental standards along the supply chain Longer-term, reliable and resilient business relationships with our suppliers Support of local suppliers in the operating markets Ensuring resilience of our supply chain Policies and obligations Group procurement directive Code of Conduct Supplier Code of Conduct Objectives and targets Every new and extended supply contract is subject to the Groupwide Supplier Code of Conduct Establishment of an audit programme for assessment, definition of preventive measures and monitoring by 2024 Measures taken Supplier Code of Conduct introduced in 2023 Relevant key indicators GRI 204-1 Proportion of spending on local suppliers GRI 308-1 New suppliers that were screened using environmental criteria GRI 308-2 Negative environmental impacts in the supply chain and actions taken GRI 408-1 Operations and suppliers at significant risk for incidents of child labour GRI 409-1 Operations and suppliers at significant risk for incidents of forced or compulsory labour GRI 414-1 New suppliers that were screened using social criteria GRI 414-2 Negative social impacts in the supply chain and actions taken\n\nBuilding a sustainable and transparent supply chain is one of the greatest challenges in sustainability management for many companies. Various crises have demonstrated the importance of resilient value chains. This is also reflected in current regulations on corporate due diligence, in particular the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains (LkSG) or the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD). In this context, IMMOFINANZ is also working continuously to establish sustainable supply chain management.\n\nThus suppliers commissioned by IMMOFINANZ during the reporting period are broadly diversified and range from construction companies and property management firms to consulting service providers, insurance companies and IT companies. In the 2023 financial year, IMMOFINANZ procured services and products from more than 3,000 suppliers (2022: 3,000) with a total order volume of more than EUR 210 million (2022: EUR 201.5 million). As an international company, IMMOFINANZ worked with suppliers from 26 countries in the 2023 financial year. In order to ensure that procurement practices are sustainable and to maintain longterm, partnership-based relationships with our suppliers, 91% (2022: 97%) of all providers come directly from the markets in which IMMOFINANZ operates. Supporting these local suppliers and contributing to value creation in our core operating markets are therefore central considerations.\n\nThe process of selecting business partners is based on the internal Group procurement directive, which defines the procedures and specifications for IMMOFINANZ's procurement activities. In line with the Code of Conduct, these guidelines call for the careful selection of suppliers. A key concern is to minimise supplier risks resulting from child, forced or compulsory labour as well as risks arising from inadequate social assessment of the supplier. To this end, work is currently underway on a risk mapping process that will be applied to IMMOFINANZ's suppliers. The Procurement department reviews every new supplier based on their external presence (e.g. website) for indications which might call the company's integrity and authenticity into question. In addition, Procurement conducts credit risk assessments for potential suppliers which are expected to be \n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\nmaterial. In the event of a negative rating, the suppliers will not be listed. In addition to the responsible selection of suppliers, continuous efforts are made to intensify the exchange of communication between IMMOFINANZ and its business partners.\n\nAs part of its ESG strategy, IMMOFINANZ developed a Group-wide standardised Supplier Code of Conduct during the reporting year. This code is a mandatory contract component for every new contract and for contract extensions. It can be viewed on our website at https://immofinanz.com/en/sustainability.\n\n## Basis for preparation\n\nAs a company of public interest, IMMOFINANZ voluntarily prepares a non-financial statement in accordance with § 267a of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB) and thus also discloses information pursuant to the EU Taxonomy.\n\n#### Reporting standards\n\nThis report has been drawn up in accordance with the GRI standards. For the first time, IMMOFINANZ received the EPRA Sustainability Best Practices Recommendations Gold Award for its non-financial reporting in the 2022 annual report. The key indicators reported are based on the Sustainability Best Practices Recommendations Guidelines (2017) issued by the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA). In addition, the tables in this report have been adapted to the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), which are applicable starting from 2024, in accordance with the current interpretation.\n\n#### Reporting period\n\nThe non-financial statement covers the period from 1 January to 31 December 2023. The indicators for 2022 are reported to allow comparability.\n\n#### Scope of companies and portfolio\n\nThis report covers IMMOFINANZ AG and all consolidated subsidiaries including S IMMO (see section 8 of the consolidated financial statements of the 2023 annual report). The portfolio of the company including S IMMO comprised 432 standing investment properties as of 31 December 2023.\n\nThe indicators published concentrate on the activities of IMMOFINANZ Group in Austria, Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Serbia, Croatia and Italy. The properties are included in the reporting in accordance with the financial control principle. The operational control principle was used for the greenhouse gas accounting.\n\n#### Coverage and segment analysis\n\nThis report refers to the portfolio of IMMOFINANZ Group. To enable a meaningful analysis, the portfolio has been presented as a whole and split into segments in line with the structure of our financial reporting. In the EPRA tables, the indicators are presented separately according to our two main portfolio sectors, \"office\" and \"retail\" as well as by segment. Further information can be found in the tables on EPRA Sustainability Performance Measures (Environment). Due to different calculation methods and reference values, the ESRS and EPRA figures may differ.\n\nThe coverage rate regarding the evironmental indicators amounts to 100%.\n\n#### Information on the company's own business premises\n\nThe consumption figures for the operation of IMMOFINANZ Group's own office spaces are no longer reported separately as their share is immaterial. The business premises are largely owned by IMMOFINANZ and usage is shared with tenants. Therefore, the consumption of IMMOFINANZ Group's business premises is included in the totals.\n\n{86}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Consumption data\n\nThe objective was to use real data for all types of energy consumption (gas, electricity, district heating) , as well as water consumption for the twelve-month period. To this end, automatically transmitted data (smart metering), read-out data and data from utility company invoices were used. Where no complete data was available, consumption was estimated using appropriate assumptions based on lettable space. Where no data was available for the full year 2023, data from 2022 was used. The consumption of buildings purchased or sold during the year was considered for the full months in which these buildings were part of the portfolio.\n\n#### Waste\n\nWaste data is disclosed in absolute figures again this year. These are based on the invoices of the respective waste disposal companies. Where data was not available for individual sites, it was complemented with comparable figures, calculated using country- and asset-specific real data, or estimated. Where no data was available for the full year 2023, data from 2022 was used.\n\n#### External audit\n\nThis report has not undergone an external audit.\n\n#### CO2 footprint\n\nThe CO2 footprint calculation is based on the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard. Emissions are stated in CO2 equivalent (CO2e) terms. The CO2e values for electricity and district heating are based on information by the energy suppliers and on publicly available sources, including the European data from the Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB) as well as the government conversion factors of the British Department for Energy Security. As in 2022, missing Scope 3 emissions were estimated based on real data and spaces. Where no data was available for the reporting period, data from the previous year was used. CO2 emissions are verified at Group level.\n\n#### Employee indicators\n\nAll indicators in the employee section are stated based on the headcount (HC) at all fully consolidated companies including S IMMO as of 31 December 2023 (excluding the Executive Board and inactive employees). If an indicator is calculated on a different basis, this is shown in a footnote. The data underlying the calculation of the indicators is produced by the IMMOFINANZ personnel management software and complemented with the data provided by S IMMO.\n\n#### Boundaries of reporting – landlord and tenant utility consumption\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group reports the water and energy consumption of the owner (IMMOFINANZ) (\"within the organisation\"). In cases where tenants obtained energy or water directly from the utility company and the data was not provided, this share was added based on comparative values specific to the building (\"outside of the organisation\").\n\n#### Normalisation\n\nFor the intensity indicators (energy intensity, water intensity, CO2 intensity) the reference total area of the buildings was used as the denominator. In addition to the total lettable area of properties that formed part of the portfolio throughout the year, the total lettable area of properties that were purchased or sold during the year were normalised on a monthly basis so that the area is equivalent to the number of months relevant for the report on a pro rata basis. The intensity calculated contains the consumption obtained as described above.\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT Voluntary Consolidated

In this process, only the economic activity under \"7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings\" was identified as a relevant economic activity for the business model of IMMOFINANZ Group in the past financial year. In June 2023, the Delegated Regulations (EU) 2023/2485 and (EU) 2023/2486 were published by the European Commission.\n\nThe Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486 defines new technical screening criteria for the four non-climate-related environmental objectives of the EU Environmental Taxonomy. The new screening criteria refer to both economic activities already covered by the EU Environmental Taxonomy and those previously not covered. Moreover, the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 on reporting has been amended.\n\nIn the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2485, the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 is amended with respect to the two climate-related environmental objectives of the EU Taxonomy. It contains new technical screening criteria which also refer to both economic activities already covered by the EU Taxonomy and those not yet covered.\n\nIn addition, a \"Commission notice on the interpretation and implementation of certain legal provisions of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and links to the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (2023/C 211/01)\" (FAQ) was published in June 2023.\n\nThe Regulations which entered into force in 2023 and the FAQ were reviewed and analysed in detail. The following changes to taxonomy reporting were identified for IMMOFINANZ Group:\n\nThe revenues from S IMMO's hotel operations are reported under \"Income from owner-operated properties\" in the IMMOFINANZ Group consolidated financial statements. Due to improvements in data collection, data is available for the first time for the activities \"7.3 Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficient equipment\" and \"7.6 Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technology\" so that these categories have also been newly included in reporting.\n\nAs the economic activity \"7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings\" does not constitute an enabling activity pursuant to Article 16 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, no revenues may be reported as taxonomy-eligible or taxonomy-aligned under the environmental objective \"climate change adaptation\". In addition, no adaptation solutions for significant physical climate risks have been implemented so far, which is why no capital expenditures (CapEx) or operating expenditures (OpEx) can currently be reported under the above-mentioned environmental objective. Therefore, the entire taxonomy-aligned revenues, capital expenditures (CapEx) and operating expenditures (OpEx) were reviewed for a significant contribution to the environmental objective \"climate change mitigation\" using the technical screening criteria.\n\nSince the description of economic activity 7.7 and the definition of the technical screening criteria are based on the exercise of ownership of real estate, neither revenues, CapEx nor OpEx in connection with undeveloped land are subsumed under this economic activity. Additions to other intangible assets and other tangible assets are also classified as non-taxonomy-eligible.\n\nWith regard to economic activity 7.3, meeting the criteria of Directive 2010/31/EU and, if applicable, classification in the two best energy efficiency classes according to Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 are intended as substantial contributions. To prevent significant harm, the company plans to conduct a climate risk analysis as applied under 7.7 as well as compliance with the generic criteria for DNSH to pollution prevention regarding\n\n<sup>∗</sup> FAQ 18: Draft commission notice on the interpretation and implementation of certain legal provisions of the Disclosures Delegated Act under Article 8 of EU Taxonomy Regulation on the reporting of taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned economic activities and assets (second Commission Notice)\n\n{124}------------------------------------------------\n\nthe presence of chemicals. We summarise capital expenditures for the installation of energy-efficient cooling systems under this activity.\n\nEconomic activity 7.6 only requires the existence of one of the renewable energy technologies listed for a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation; therefore, heat pumps and photovoltaic systems meet this requirement. A climate risk analysis as applied under 7.7 is planned in order to prevent significant harm. We summarise capital expenditure for the installation of heat pumps and of photovoltaic equipment under this activity.\n\n#### Taxonomy alignment of IMMOFINANZ Group\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group continued to pursue a conservative and strict assessment approach in the 2023 financial year. IMMOFINANZ Group is aware that a less stringent interpretation of the criteria by other market participants may possibly lead to significantly higher shares of taxonomy-aligned activities.\n\n#### Economic Activity \"7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings\"\n\n#### Substantial contribution to climate change mitigation (SC)\n\nWhen reviewing buildings for a substantial contribution to the environmental objective \"climate change mitigation\", a distinction was made, in accordance with the technical screening criteria, as to whether or not the application for a building permit for the respective building was submitted before 31 December 2020.\n\nFor buildings where an application for a building permit was submitted before 31 December 2020, the first step was to examine whether the energy performance certificate (EPC) of the building shows an energy class. To meet the requirements, the energy performance certificate of the building must show at least energy class A. This assessment method was applied to all countries relevant for IMMOFINANZ Group, with the exception of Poland and Germany. As no energy classes exist in these countries, an alternative calculation method was used here. Instead of the energy class, the primary energy demand (PED) of the building is considered, as is done for buildings for which the building permit application was submitted after 31 December 2020. If the nationally defined threshold value for nearly zero-energy buildings is undercut by at least 10%, this part of the criterion is also considered to be met.\n\nAs an alternative to energy efficiency class A, a building can meet the technical screening criteria if it ranks among the top 15% of the national or regional building stock in terms of primary energy demand. For this purpose, a study of CEVRE Consultants s.r.o. commissioned by Česká spořitelna, a.s. was used for buildings in the Czech Republic. This study classifies office buildings of the energy efficiency classes A, B and C (up to primary energy demand of 260 kWh/sqm) as well as retail buildings of the energy classes A, B and C (up to primary energy demand of 545 kWh/sqm) as the top 15% of the national building stock.\n\nOffice buildings, retail parks and shopping centers with more than 5,000 sqm of usable space were examined for the existence of heating systems, systems for combined space heating and ventilation, air-conditioning systems or systems for combined air conditioning and ventilation with more than 290 kW of power. Where this criterion applies, checks were subsequently carried out to determine whether they are efficiently operated and have a continuous monitoring system.\n\nFor buildings for which the building permit application was submitted after 31 December 2020, it must be verified whether the primary energy demand of the respective building is at least 10% below the national threshold for nearly zero-energy buildings. In addition, it must be determined whether the usable space of the building exceeds 5,000 sqm. If this is the case, airtightness of the building envelope and thermal integration upon completion as well the global warming potential (GWP) viewed over the entire life cycle must be demonstrated for each phase of the life cycle in addition to the criterion of efficient operation. Since there are currently no life cycle assessments for these properties, taxonomy alignment cannot yet be shown in this category.\n\n{125}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Do no significant harm (DNSH)\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the economic activity \"7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings\", IMMOFINANZ Group conducts a climate risk and vulnerability assessment at the site level in order to prevent significant harm to the environmental objective \"climate change adaptation\". In doing so, a model of a time horizon until 2050 has been used so far assuming the worst-case scenario (RCP 8.5). Appropriate adaptation plans have been drawn up where necessary.\n\nCommission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 does not provide for DNSH criteria for other environmental objectives for the economic activity 7.7.\n\n#### Economic activities \"7.3 Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficient equipment\" and \"7.6 Installation, maintenance and repair of renewable energy technology\"\n\nDue to improved data collection, taxonomy-aligned capital expenditures can be reported under these economic activities for the first time for the 2023 financial year.\n\n#### Minimum safeguards (MS)\n\nIn its FAQ of June 2023, the European Commission for the first time specified concrete requirements for compliance with the minimum safeguards, which are laid down in Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852. In addition to the previously required compliance with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights including the ILO Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the International Charter of Human Rights, a connection to the DNSH principle was established in accordance with the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). In this context, the topics of human rights (including labour and consumer rights), anti-bribery and anti-corruption, taxation and fair competition were addressed. On the topic of human rights, IMMOFINANZ Group adheres to the six-step due diligence process to prevent significant harm according to the guidelines within the OECD Guidelines.\n\n| Adverse sustainability indicator                                                                                                                                     | Metric                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Status IMMOFINANZ Group                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Violations of UN Global Compact (UNGC)<br>principles and Organisation for Economic<br>Cooperation and Development (OECD)<br>Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises | Violations of UNGC principles and OECD<br>Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises                                                                                                                                                                                                   | No violations were reported in the 2023<br>financial year.                                                                                                                                          |\n| Lack of processes and compliance mecha<br>nisms to monitor compliance with UN<br>Global Compact principles and OECD<br>Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises      | Lack of policies to monitor compliance<br>with UNGC principles and OECD Guide<br>lines for Multinational Enterprises or lack<br>of grievance/complaints handling mecha<br>nisms to address violations of the UNGC<br>principles or OECD Guidelines for Multi<br>national Enterprises | The corresponding due diligence pro<br>cesses are in place at<br>IMMOFINANZ Group.                                                                                                                  |\n| Unadjusted gender pay gap                                                                                                                                            | Average unadjusted gender pay gap                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Gender pay gap has been reported since<br>2020.

performance indicators at a glance\n\nThe complete tables on Art. 2 no. 2 Commission Delegated Regulation 2021/2178 can be found in section \"performance indicators of the EU taxonomy\".\n\n#### Revenues\n\nThe proportion of taxonomy-aligned economic activities in total revenues was calculated as the part of net revenues derived from products and services associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities (numerator), divided by net revenues (denominator), each for the financial year from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023.\n\nIn accordance with the Delegated Act on Art. 8 of the EU Taxonomy, the revenue KPI is based on the consolidated revenues of IMMOFINANZ Group (see the consolidated income statement in the consolidated financial statements of the 2023 annual report) and relates primarily to rental income and operating costs charged to tenants. The numerator of the revenue KPI is based on the taxonomy-aligned proportion of the economic activity \"7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings\" with reference to making a substantial contribution to the environmental objective \"climate change mitigation\" and is broken down into the following items:\n\n| in MEUR                                | 2023  | 2022  |\n|----------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Revenues from contracts with customers | 190.6 | 118.6 |\n| Revenues from leases                   | 533.6 | 300.2 |\n| Other revenues                         | 2.7   | 3.4   |\n| IMMOFINANZ Group                       | 727.0 | 422.2 |\n\nThe increase in total revenues is caused by the first-time consolidation of S IMMO.\n\n#### Capital expenditures (CapEx)\n\nThe key performance indicator capital expenditure (CapEx) is defined as the proportion of taxonomy-aligned capital expenditures (numerator) divided by IMMOFINANZ Group's total capital expenditures (denominator).\n\nThe denominator comprises additions to investment property, property under construction, owner-operated property, other tangible assets and intangible assets for the 2023 financial year before depreciation and amortisation and revaluations. In the 2023 financial year, no additions resulting from business combinations which could have been taken into account for the denominator occurred. Our total capital expenditures essentially correspond to the sum of additions including changes in the scope of consolidation in accordance with the statement of changes in fixed assets (see 4.1 and 4.2 in the consolidated financial statements). Differences result from including additions to owner-operated property, other tangible assets and intangible assets in the denominator of the CapEx KPI which are not presented separately in the notes. The numerator includes capital expenditures related to assets or processes that are associated with taxonomy-aligned proportions of economic activity 7.7. Here, IMMOFINANZ Group considers capital expenditures that are material to maintaining and performing the economic activity. The principle of allocation here is the generation of external revenues\n\n{127}------------------------------------------------\n\nthrough the economic activity \"7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings\". Consequently, all capital expenditures in taxonomy-aligned properties are considered in the numerator of the performance indicator.\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group analysed the requirements for a CapEx plan, and came to the decision not to prepare a CapEx plan in the 2023 financial year. This is because prior to preparing the CapEx plan it must be ensured that any upgrading measures can actually guarantee meeting the criteria to make a substantial contribution to one of the environmental objectives. The aim is therefore to prepare a CapEx plan in the 2024 financial year.\n\nDue to the continuous improvement in data collection, CapEx category C can be shown in 2023 for the first time. In order to avoid double counting of capital expenditures, IMMOFINANZ Group only recognised capital expenditures under category C which are not related to taxonomy-aligned properties. Capital expenditures relating to taxonomy-aligned buildings are recognised under category A.\n\nThe numerator of taxonomy-aligned capital expenditures can be broken down as follows in accordance with Annex 1 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178:\n\n| in MEUR                                                      | 2023  | 2022  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment                         | 8.2   | 0.0   |\n| IAS 40 Investment property                                   | 379.2 | 275.6 |\n| IFRS 16 Leases (>12 months)                                  | 0.0   | 0.0   |\n| IMMOFINANZ Group                                             | 387.4 | 275.6 |\n| thereof resulting from changes in the scope of consolidation | 354.7 | 232.5 |\n\nThe increase in total capital expenditures is caused by the first-time consolidation of S IMMO.\n\n#### Operating expenditure (OpEx)\n\nThe key performance indicator operating expenditure (OpEx) is defined as the proportion of taxonomy-aligned operating expenditures (numerator) divided by total operating expenditures (denominator). The classification of the operating expenditures can be derived analogously from the categories of capital expenditures.\n\nTotal operating expenditures consist of non-capitalised costs that relate to building renovation measures, maintenance and repair as well as any other direct expenditures in connection with the day-to-day servicing of investment property, property under construction and owner-operated property.\n\nThe numerator of taxonomy-aligned operating expenditure can be broken down as follows pursuant to Annex 1 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178:\n\n| in MEUR                                       | 2023 | 2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Costs related to building renovation measures | 0.3  | 0.4  |\n| Maintenance and repair costs                  | 3.0  | 2.7  |\n| S IMMO                                        | 0.8  | 0.0  |\n| IMMOFINANZ Group                              | 4.1  | 3.1  |\n\nThe increase in total operating expenditures is caused by the first-time consolidation of S IMMO.\n\nWe exclude direct training costs from the denominator and the numerator. The reason is that Annex I of the Delegated Act on the disclosure only lists these costs for the numerator, which does not allow for a mathematically meaningful calculation of the OpEx KPI.\n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Template: Proportion of turnover from products or services associated with taxonomy-aligned economic activities – disclosure covering year 2023\n\n| 2023                                                                                                                                     |          |          |                                   | Substantial contribution criteria  |                                    |                                  |                                  |                                  |                                  | DNSH criteria (do no significant harm) (h) |                                 |             |                 |                       |                    |                    |                                                                      |                              |                                  |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Economic<br>activities                                                                                                                   | Code (a) | Turnover | Proportion<br>of turnover<br>2023 | Climate change<br>mitigation (CCM) | Climate change<br>adaptation (CCA) | Water (WTR)                      | Pollution (PPC)                  | Circular<br>economy (CE)         | Biodiversity (BIO)               | Climate change mitigation (CCM)            | Climate change adaptation (CCA) | Water (WTR) | Pollution (PPC) | Circular economy (CE) | Biodiversity (BIO) | Minimum safeguards | Proportion of taxonomy-aligned (A.1) or eligible (A.2) turnover 2022 | Category (enabling activity) | Category (transitional activity) |\n|                                                                                                                                          |          | in MEUR  | in %                              | Y; N;<br>N/EL<br>(b) (c)<br>in %   | Y; N;<br>N/EL<br>(b) (c)<br>in %   | Y; N;<br>N/EL<br>(b) (c)<br>in % | Y; N;<br>N/EL<br>(b) (c)<br>in % | Y; N;<br>N/EL<br>(b) (c)<br>in % | Y; N;<br>N/EL<br>(b) (c)<br>in % | Y/N                                        | Y/N                             | Y/N         | Y/N             | Y/N                   | Y/N                | Y/N                | in %                                                                 | E                            | T                                |\n| A.

In order to be optimally positioned to also offer efficient and profitably manageable property solutions in the future, IMMOFINANZ Group monitors the changes in work processes as well as the influence of environmental factors and tenants' demands on space and building concepts. The focus on training and continuing education has been increased to support internal innovation strength and sustainability efforts. IMMOFINANZ Group also maintains regular contacts with other companies and organisations and is a member of numerous associations and institutions like IG Lebenszyklus, the Austrian Council of Shopping Places and the Green Building Council. Apart from these diverse activities, IMMOFINANZ Group did not invest any funds in 2023 that could be classified as conventional research and development. This type of information is therefore not provided.\n\n## Outlook\n\n## Expected market environment\n\nHigh inflation, a rapid increase in interest rates, the collapse of the real estate transaction market and a generally weak economy were the determining factors in 2023. According to the experts, current macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions will prevent any changes in the challenging market environment during 2024. Economic growth in the eurozone is projected to be low at 1.2% based on an inflation rate that remains high at roughly 3.2%.\n\nThese developments also represent an uncertainty factor for the real estate market. Rising financing costs and pressure on property prices have a persistent negative effect. Inflation is still above the 2.0% target, which facilitates an increase in rents covered by indexed contracts but, at the same time, weakens consumers' purchasing power. Most experts only see a market recovery in the second half of 2024. IMMOFINANZ Group – with its flexible and resilient real estate products – believes it is well positioned in spite of the current challenging environment. We intend to consequently develop our core business as a growth-oriented property owner and work to further optimise the portfolio.\n\n## Property portfolio and sustainability\n\nRetail property acquisitions and completions in 2023 more than offset strategic sales, and the carrying amount of IMMOFINANZ Group's portfolio was only a slight -2% lower year-on-year at EUR 8.2 billion as of 31 December 2023. The standing investment portfolio totalled EUR 7.8 billion and included EUR 1.9 billion, or roughly 24% of office properties, EUR 2.6 billion, or roughly 33% of retail properties, and EUR 3.3 billion, or roughly 42% for S IMMO.\n\nOur portfolio strategy continues to rely on resilient and cost-efficient retail properties and innovative office solutions. They include the established myhive, STOP SHOP and VIVO! brands as well as complementary products and portfolios. We plan to expand the offering in our core countries over the medium term but in the current market environment, our main objective will be to strengthen the retail portfolio through our own development projects and selective acquisitions.\n\n{137}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe optimisation programme for our portfolio is progressing. As part of our active portfolio management, we sold properties with a combined value of approximately EUR 751 million (including S IMMO) in 2023. The related activities in 2024 will continue to concentrate on the sale of lower yielding properties that bring attractive sale prices as well as non-strategic properties. The proceeds will be reinvested, as in the past, in valuecreating acquisitions and/or development projects.\n\nIMMOFINANZ as part of the CPI Property Group, approved the Group-wide adjustment and standardisation of the ESG strategy in 2023, which covers ecological sustainability as well as social aspects and good corporate governance. Our goal is to make an extensive contribution to the sustainable development of the real estate branch by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the use of renewable energies, decreasing water consumption and improving the recycling rate. Our plans for 2024 include, among others, the further expansion of photovoltaic equipment at our properties. The green lease contracts introduced in 2023 have been implemented in all our core markets and will be offered to tenants as part of our rental activities.\n\n## Financing and the capital market\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group has a very solid capital and financing structure with an equity ratio of 47.3%, a net loanto-value (net LTV) ratio of 42.1%, and cash and cash equivalents of EUR 697.1 million at the end of December 2023. An unsecured, revolving corporate credit line of EUR 100.0 million is also available. Roughly 95% of our financial liabilities are hedged against rising interest rates, and our goal is to continue this conservative financial policy. Gearing, based on the net LTV, should therefore remain at a conservative level over the medium term.\n\nOur focus in the current market environment lies primarily on long-term bank financing. For new financing as well as refinancing at the property level, we benefit from long-term, cooperative relationships with banks in our core markets. After the successful refinancing of approximately EUR 1 billion of bank liabilities in 2023, we are currently meeting with our financing banks to discuss the premature extension of expiring financing at the current market conditions.\n\nMost experts anticipate a reduction in key eurozone interest rates by the European Central Bank (ECB) in 2024. These prospects have recently led to a more optimistic mood in the real estate sector. Transactions could therefore increase during the second half of 2024, due to a more attractive climate based on lower interest rates and stabilised yields.\n\n## Close cooperation with CPIPG and S IMMO\n\nWork on the integration of IMMOFINANZ and S IMMO started in 2022. Under the direction of the CPI Property Group (CPIPG), we bundled resources in asset and property management and in other service areas to optimise our organisational structures and significantly improve efficiency. These activities successfully continued with the signing of a framework agreement with S IMMO to evaluate further integration options. We have already realised synergies, including common service contracts and the standardisation of IT systems and processes. The CPI Property Group, as the core shareholder of IMMOFINANZ, is actively supporting this process with an aim towards the identification and realisation of further synergies. In spite of this progress, our tenants remain our first priority. We intend to continue offering optimal property solutions in the future to further strengthen our leading position in the branch.\n\n{138}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-138-0\"></span>This outlook reflects the Executive Board's assessments as of 27 March 2024 and includes statements and forecasts concerning the future development of IMMOFINANZ Group.

Statements\n\n## 1. General Principles\n\n## 1.1 Reporting company\n\nIMMOFINANZ AG is the parent company of IMMOFINANZ GROUP (incl. S IMMO), a listed real estate company in Austria. Its registered headquarters are located at Wienerbergstrasse 9, 1100 Vienna. The business activities of IMMOFINANZ Group comprise the development, acquisition, rental and commercial utilisation of properties as well as the operation of hotels. The IMMOFINANZ AG share is listed in the Prime Market segment of the Vienna Stock Exchange and in the Main Market segment of the Warsaw Stock Exchange.\n\nCPI Property Group (CPIPG), which is headquartered in Luxembourg, is the parent company that prepares consolidated financial statements for the largest circle of companies. These consolidated financial statements are published at the corporate headquarters.\n\nThe purchase of 17,305,012 S IMMO AG shares from CPIPG at the end of December 2022 gave IMMOFINANZ a majority investment of 50% plus one share in S IMMO. S IMMO was therefore included through full consolidation in the IMMOFINANZ consolidated financial statements for 2022. The consolidated income statement for the 2022 financial year did not include any components for the S IMMO Group for practicality reasons. The comparability with prior year data is therefore limited.\n\n## 1.2 Basis of reporting\n\nThese consolidated financial statements of IMMOFINANZ AG cover the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. They were prepared in accordance with § 245a (1) of the Austrian Commercial Code and in agreement with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in the euro, which is the functional currency of the parent company. All financial information reported in the euro is rounded to thousand euros, unless indicated otherwise. The use of automatic data processing equipment can lead to rounding differences in the addition of rounded amounts and percentage rates.\n\nUniform accounting policies are used to measure the assets and liabilities of all Group companies, whereby these items are basically measured individually. Disposal groups represent an exception to this practice and are reported under \"assets held for sale\" and \"liabilities held for sale\" (see section 4.10). In addition, impairment\n\n{147}------------------------------------------------\n\nlosses are calculated in part on the basis of cash-generating units if the recoverable amount of specific assets (goodwill) cannot be determined separately (see section 4.5.2).\n\nAssets and liabilities are generally measured at amortised cost. For financial assets and liabilities, this involves the application of the effective interest rate method. In contrast, different measurement methods are applied to the following material positions:\n\n- Investment property, property under construction and owner-operated properties are measured at fair value.\n- Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.\n- Provisions are measured at the present value of the expected settlement amount.\n- Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are measured at their nominal value based on the temporary differences as of the balance sheet date and the tax rate expected when the existing differences are realised.\n- Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell unless they are excluded from the valuation requirements defined in IFRS 5. This applies, in particular, to investment property that is measured based on the fair value model.\n\nFair value is not always available as an observable market price, but must often be determined on the basis of various valuation parameters. Depending on the availability of observable parameters and the importance of these parameters for the general assessment procedure, the fair values are classified in different levels on the fair value hierarchy:\n\n- Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) on active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n- Level 2: valuation parameters that do not reflect the quoted prices defined for Level 1, but which can be derived directly (as a price) or indirectly (from prices) for the asset or liability\n- Level 3: valuation parameters for assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data\n\n### 1.3 Judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\n#### 1.3.1 Judgments\n\nThe following notes provide information on judgements made in the application of accounting methods which have the greatest influence on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements:\n\n- Full consolidation (see section 2.2.2): assessment of the existence of control over subsidiaries in cases where control is not based solely on the ownership interest (de facto control) and assessment of the existence of joint control or significant influence when a majority holding does not convey control over an investment\n- Full consolidation (see section 2.2.2): assessment of whether the acquisition of property companies represents business combinations in the sense of IFRS 3 (characteristics of a business)\n- Equity accounting (see section 2.2.3): assessment of the existence of significant influence in contrast to the assumption of such influence at an ownership interest of 20% or more and evaluation of the existence of objective indications of impairment\n- Functional currency (see section 2.6.1): determination of the functional currency of a foreign operation, above all when this currency differs from the currency of the subsidiary's headquarters country\n- Rental income (see section 5.1.1): assessment of the term of rental agreements with regard to the use of extension options and assessment of whether the modification to a rental agreement substantively represents a new rental relationship\n\n#### 1.3.2 Assumptions and estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the Executive Board to make assumptions and estimates related to the application of accounting methods and the amounts reported for assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results can vary from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed regularly, and any changes to these estimates are recognised prospectively. The following notes provide information on assumptions and estimation uncertainty which can lead to a significant risk that a material adjustment will be required during the next financial year.\n\n{148}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Valuation assumptions and existing uncertainty (see section 4.1.3): determination of the fair value of investment property, property under construction and owner-operated properties\n- Rights of use and lease liabilities (see sections 4.1.1 and 4.14): determination of the remaining term of a lease together with any extension or cancellation options\n- Goodwill (see section 4.5.2): determination of the recoverable amount within the scope of impairment tests\n- Equity-accounted investments (see section 4.6): determination of the recoverable amount within the scope of impairment tests for investments in associates and determination of the fair value of investments in associates within the framework of purchase price allocation in the case of a transitional consolidation\n- Contingent receivables (see section 7.3.1): contingent receivables may only be recognised when their realisation as income is highly probable\n- Deferred taxes (see section 4.9): assessment of the usability of deferred tax assets (above all from loss carryforwards)\n- Real estate inventories (see section 4.11): determination of the net realisable value of inventories\n- Provisions (see section 4.16): determination of the expected settlement amount and the related present value\n- Financial instruments (see section 7.1.3): determination of the fair value of primary and derivative financial instruments\n- Contingent liabilities and guarantees (see section 7.3.1): assessment of the expected claims from obligations not reported on the balance sheet\n\nThe current macroeconomic situation, with its rising interest rates and high inflation, has a potential impact on the above-mentioned balance sheet positions. This has been manifested, above all, through an increase in the financing costs for new borrowings and in the valuation of interest derivatives, which has significantly affected the financial result. A quantitative evaluation of future events and trends is not possible from the current point of view. These developments have been reflected in both costs and earnings – in particular, through an upward trend in operating costs and revenues from the charge-out of these costs and, subsequently, in an inflationdriven increase in rents and an improvement in the like-for-like performance of rents. Rising prices are also visible in the costs of construction. These developments are important for property valuation because the key valuation parameters are based on the prevailing market conditions on the respective closing date. This led to substantial write-downs in 2023, and also to a lesser extent in 2022, and to negative \"valuation results from standing investments\" (also see section 5.8). The future movements of discount and capitalisation rates are also impossible to predict in this area. IMMOFINANZ Group is not directly affected by the war in Ukraine because the Group holds no property and has no business relations in that country. The Group is, however, indirectly affected through the effects of the war in Ukraine on the overall economic situation. A quantitative estimate of these indirect effects on the Group is not possible at the present time.\n\n{149}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 1.4 First-time application of standards and interpretations\n\nThe following new or revised standards and interpretations were applied for the first time in 2023:\n\n| Standard                                 | Content                                                                                                   | Published by the IASB<br>(adopted by the EU) | Mandatory<br>application for<br>IMMOFINANZ | Effects on<br>IMMOFINANZ |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| New standards and interpretations        |                                                                                                           |                                              |                                            |                          |\n| IFRS 17                                  | Insurance contracts                                                                                       | 18 May 2017<br>(8 September 2022)            | on application                             | No                       |\n| Changes to standards and interpretations |                                                                                                           |                                              |                                            |                          |\n| IAS 1                                    | Disclosure of accounting and measurement<br>policies                                                      | 12 February 2021<br>(3 March 2022)           | 1 January 2023                             | No                       |\n| IAS 12                                   | Change to IAS 12 – Deferred tax related to<br>assets and liabilities arising from a single<br>transaction | 7 May 2021<br>(12 August 2022)               | 1 January 2023                             | No                       |\n| IAS 12                                   | Change to IAS 12 – International tax re<br>form – Pillar two model rules                                  | 23 May 2023<br>(8 November 2023)             | 1 January 2023                             | Yes                      |\n| IAS 8                                    | Definition of accounting policies and ac-<br>counting estimates                                           | 12 February 2021<br>(3 March 2022)           | 1 January 2023                             | No                       |\n\n#### IFRS 17 Insurance contracts\n\nIFRS 17 regulates the accounting treatment of insurance contracts and replaces the previously applicable transition standard, IFRS 4. The scope of application of this standard covers insurance contracts, reinsurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary net income participation.\n\nThese changes had no effect on the consolidated financial statements because IMMOFINANZ Group holds no insurance contracts which fall under these categories.\n\n#### IAS 1: Disclosure of accounting and measurement policies\n\nThe changes clarify the requirements of IAS 1 concerning the disclosure of accounting and measurement policies. They replace all sections previously entitled \"(significant) accounting policies\" by the term \"(material) accounting policy information\". Information on accounting policies is considered material when it, together with other financial statement information, can reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of IFRS financial statements make on the basis of those financial statements.\n\nIn addition, the changes clarify that accounting policy information concerning immaterial transactions, other events and conditions are considered to be immaterial and must not be disclosed. Accounting policy information can be material because of the nature of the related transactions, other events or conditions, even if the amounts are immaterial. However, not all accounting policy information relating to material transactions, other events or conditions is itself material.\n\nThe IASB has also prepared guidelines and examples to explain the application of the four-step process model that is included in IFRS Practice Statement 2.\n\nThese changes had no material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### IAS 12: Changes to IAS 12 – Deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction\n\nThese changes further limit the scope of application of the initial recognition exemption. Consequently, a company may not apply the exemption to transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.\n\nDepending on current tax law, equal taxable and deductible temporary differences can arise on the initial recognition of an asset and a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and does not affect either accounting or taxable profits. This could occur, for example, on the recognition of a lease liability and the corresponding right-of-use asset under the application of IFRS 16 (Leases) at the beginning of the lease.\n\nCompanies are now only required to recognise the related deferred tax assets and liabilities, whereby the recognition of a deferred tax asset is subject to the materiality criteria defined in IAS 12 (Income taxes).\n\n{150}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Group has not recorded any deferred taxes to date which resulted from transactions that led to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The changes result in deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities of EUR 11.6 million each and, consequently, there is no material net effect.\n\n#### IAS 12: Change to IAS 12 – International tax reform – Pillar two model rules\n\nThe changes introduce a mandatory temporary exception to the accounting rules for deferred taxes arising from the implementation of the Pillar two model rules. Accordingly, the recognition of deferred taxes based on the design of supplementary taxes within the framework of the Pillar two minimum tax regime is excluded from the scope of application of this standard. Additional disclosures in the notes are also required, but are dependent on the status of implementation of the minimum tax legislation in the respective national tax laws.\n\nThe relevant disclosures are provided in section 4.9.\n\n#### IAS 8: Definition of accounting policies and accounting estimates\n\nThis standard previously included only a definition of changes in accounting estimates but no definition of accounting estimates. The new definition involves accounting estimates for monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty.\n\nA change in an accounting estimate that is based on new information or new developments does not represent the correction of an error. The effects on an accounting estimate from a change in an input or measurement technique represent a change in an accounting estimate unless they result from the correction of errors from earlier periods.\n\nThe changes had no material effects on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n### 1.5 Standards and interpretations applicable in the future\n\n#### 1.5.1 Standards and interpretations adopted by the EU, but not yet applied\n\nThe following changes to standards and interpretations had been adopted by the EU as of the balance sheet date, but did not require mandatory application in the 2023 financial year and were not applied prematurely:\n\n| Standard                                 | Content                                                                                                                                                                  | Published by the IASB<br>(adopted by the EU)              | Mandatory<br>application for<br>IMMOFINANZ | Expected effects on<br>IMMOFINANZ |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Changes to standards and interpretations |                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                           |                                            |                                   |\n| IFRS 16                                  | Change to IFRS 16 – Lease liabilities in a<br>sale and leaseback transaction                                                                                             | 21 November 2023<br>(20 November 2023)                    | 1 January 2024                             | No                                |\n| IAS 1                                    | Change to IAS 1 – Classification of liabili-<br>ties as current and non-current and the de-<br>ferral of the application date; non-current<br>liabilities with covenants | 23 January 2020;<br>31 October 2022<br>(19 December 2023) | 1 January 2024                             | No                                |\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group is evaluating the applicable changes to these standards and will apply them as of the mandatory application date.

Detailed information is provided in section 2.3 and 2.4. All other subsidiaries with an investment of less than 100% (see section 8.) have no material noncontrolling interests.\n\nRestrictions defined by the articles of association, contracts or legal regulations as well as protective rights held by non-controlling interests can limit the ability of IMMOFINANZ to gain access to the Group's assets, to transfer these assets between Group companies or to utilise the coverage potential of these assets to meet liabilities. Information on the existing limitations is provided in sections 7.1.4 and 7.3.1.\n\n## 2.2 Consolidation methods\n\n#### 2.2.1 Basis of consolidation\n\nStandardised accounting and valuation principles as well as uniform options and judgements are applied by all companies included in the consolidated financial statements. Material interim profits – which arise, at most, from the intragroup transfer of investments in other companies, treasury shares, receivables or properties – are eliminated. The financial statements of all companies included through full consolidation and joint ventures accounted for at equity were prepared as of the same balance sheet date as the consolidated financial statements. For associates, the latest available financial statements form the basis for accounting. In cases where a different balance sheet date is used, any necessary adjustments are made when applying the equity method of accounting for material transactions or other events that occur between the associate's balance sheet date and IMMOFINANZ Group's balance sheet date.\n\n#### 2.2.2 Full consolidation\n\nA subsidiary is an entity that is controlled by a parent company. A subsidiary is included in the consolidated financial statements through full consolidation from the date on which IMMOFINANZ Group attains control over the subsidiary and up to the date on which control ends.\n\nA controlling influence based on voting rights is generally presumed to exist when the direct or indirect interest in an entity exceeds 50%. In individual cases (see section 8.), interests over 50% are contrasted by statutory \n\n{153}------------------------------------------------\n\nrights for a co-investor or the absence of a connection between IMMOFINANZ Group's control over the investee and the receipt of variable returns. A co-investor may be assumed to have such statutory rights, above all, when there are wide-ranging requirements for unanimity or the co-investor's agreement on decisions over material activities (e.g. the sale of investment property). Investments with a share of voting rights less than 50% are reviewed to determine whether control is established by other factors.\n\nThe acquisition of a subsidiary requires a decision as to whether the entity represents a business in the sense of IFRS 3. Assessing whether acquired property assets represent a business in the sense of IFRS 3 involves discretionary judgement and, frequently, a detailed analysis of the acquired processes and structures, above all with respect to asset and property management. A concentration test is also performed on acquisitions to determine whether the entire fair value of the acquired gross assets is concentrated primarily in a single identifiable asset or in a group of comparable assets. When a business is acquired, the transaction is accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method defined by IFRS 3. This also applies to an acquisition within the framework of a business combination achieved in stages. The related transaction costs are treated as an expense, and deferred taxes on temporary differences between the fair value of the acquired property assets and their respective tax bases are recognised in full. At IMMOFINANZ Group, goodwill (see section 4.5.2) regularly results as a technical figure because of the obligation to record deferred taxes on the difference between the fair value and the tax base of the acquired real estate assets. The acquisition method is not applied if the acquired entity does not represent a business. The acquisition of shell companies and pure landowning companies does not normally involve a business. In these cases, the acquired financial assets and assumed liabilities are measured at fair value. The total of the financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value is then deducted from the transaction price. The remaining transaction price is then allocated to the remaining identifiable assets and liabilities (primarily investment property) based on the respective fair values on the acquisition date. Deferred taxes are not recognised (initial recognition exemption), and goodwill does not arise.\n\n#### 2.2.3 Equity method\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group's interests in equity-accounted investments comprise shares in joint ventures and associates.\n\nIFRS 11 differentiates between joint ventures and joint operations. The joint arrangements in which IMMOFINANZ Group is involved generally represent joint ventures. A joint venture is a joint arrangement under which the co-investors exercise joint control over a company and (only) have rights to the company's net assets. There are no direct claims or obligations arising from the company's assets and liabilities.\n\nAssociates are companies over which IMMOFINANZ Group can exercise significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in an investee's financial and operating policy decisions without control or joint control. It is generally presumed (but can be refuted) when the direct or indirect interest in the investee equals or exceeds 20%. The possibilities for influence created by company law (e.g. through seats on a supervisory board) or other available opportunities can also lead to significant influence when an interest is less than 20%. With respect to shares in real estate funds, IMMOFINANZ Group does not have significant influence, even with an interest of 20% or more, because it is not represented in the fund's operating management or this influence is excluded by the fund's legal structure (see section 8.).\n\nIn accordance with the equity method of accounting, investments in associates or joint ventures are initially recognised at cost, including transaction costs, as of the acquisition date. Any surplus of the acquisition cost over the acquired share of identifiable assets and assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities at fair value is recognised as goodwill. Negative differences are recognised immediately to profit or loss. Goodwill represents part of the carrying amount of the investment and is not tested separately for impairment. After initial recognition, the carrying amount of the investment is increased or decreased by the proportional share of the investee's profit or loss and other comprehensive income attributable to IMMOFINANZ Group until significant influence or joint control ends. Any losses recorded by an associate or joint venture which exceed IM-MOFINANZ Group's investment in this entity are not recognised. Such losses are only recognised when the Group has a legal or actual obligation to cover the losses. The investments in companies accounted for at equity are assessed for indications of impairment as of every balance sheet date in accordance with IAS 28. If any such indications are identified, the investments are tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36.\n\n{154}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 2.3 Acquisition of subsidiaries\n\nIn addition to the general disclosures on accounting and valuation methods (see sections 1.2. and 1.3), IFRS 3 requires additional detailed information on business combinations. The purchase of shares in S IMMO AG during 2022 represented a business combination achieved in stages in the sense of IFRS 3. Due to the materiality of this transaction for an understanding of the consolidated financial statements, the relevant disclosures from the 2022 consolidated financial statements are repeated (see the following). There were no business combinations in the sense of IFRS 3 during 2023, but transactions were carried out with CPI Property Group and are described in the next section.\n\n#### Acquisition of subsidiaries from CPI Property Group in the 2023 financial year\n\nVarious transactions were concluded with CPI Property Group in 2023, which did not qualify as business combinations in the sense of IFRS 3 because there were no business operations as defined by this standard. The companies acquired through share deals represented companies with properties in the office and retail asset classes in the Czech Republic and Hungary. Of the investment property acquired, EUR 219.3 million is allocated to the Czech Republic segment and EUR 601.2 million to the S IMMO segment (see section 3.6).\n\nThe investment property was recognised at the acquisition costs resulting from the purchase transactions, including incidental acquisition costs. Standard market purchase price discounts for deferred taxes and other purchase price adjustments were recognised. An interest rate derivative carried at fair value in a higher level intermediate holding company was also recognised and subsequently led to a revaluation of EUR 117.7 million to the property in accordance with IAS 40.\n\nThe following table shows the acquired assets and assumed liabilities as well as the purchase price, which was paid in liquid funds, and the liabilities superseded in connection with the settlement of the acquisitions. These transactions are included on the consolidated cash flow statement under \"business combinations and other acquisitions, net of cash and cash equivalents\" at an amount of EUR -686.4 million.\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                              | 2023     |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Investment property                              | 820,455  |\n| Receivables and other assets                     | 24,550   |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                        | 5,060    |\n| Financial liabilities                            | -126,721 |\n| Trade and other payables                         | -34,705  |\n| Net assets acquired                              | 688,639  |\n| Purchase price paid in cash and cash equivalents | -264,481 |\n| Superseded liabilities                           | -424,157 |\n| Consideration                                    | -688,638 |\n| Less cash and cash equivalents                   | 5,060    |\n| Net outflow of cash and cash equivalents         | -683,578 |\n\n{155}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Acquisition of subsidiaries from CPI Property Group in the 2022 financial year\n\nIn the 2022 financial year, a fully let portfolio of 53 properties in the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary was acquired from the CPI Property Group. The purchase price amounted to EUR 322.2 million.\n\n#### Successive business combination in the 2022 financial year – S IMMO AG\n\nIMMOFINANZ held 19,499,437 shares up to 26 December 2022, which represented 26.49% of share capital and 27,65% of the voting rights in S IMMO. This holding represented a significant influence up to 27 December 2022 when 17,305,012 shares of S IMMO AG were purchased from CPI Property Group. The purchase of the shares previously held by CPI Property Group gave IMMOFINANZ a majority investment of 50% plus one share in the S IMMO Group. The purchase price for this share package totalled EUR 337.4 million, respectively EUR 19.50 per S IMMO share, and was deferred by CPI Property Group up to March 2028 at the latest. The deferred purchase price was paid in 2023 and is included on the cash flow statement under \"business combinations and other acquisitions, net of cash and cash equivalents\".\n\nWithin the framework of the purchase price allocation, the total consideration for the business combination included the following:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                              | 2022    |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Fair value of shares held until 27 December 2022 | 344,945 |\n| Deferred purchase price                          | 337,448 |\n| Consideration                                    | 682,393 |\n\nSince the acquisition of S IMMO Group represented a business combination achieved in stages, the total consideration included the deferred purchase price component for the additional shares purchased as well as the fair value of the shares previously held.\n\nThe allocation of the total purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities (PPA) of S IMMO Group as of the initial consolidation date was based on the closing data reported by S IMMO Group as of 31 December 2022 and on identified necessary adjustments to the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n\nThe assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the business combination had the following fair values as of the initial consolidation date:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR             | 2022      |\n|---------------------------------|-----------|\n| Investment property             | 2,412,852 |\n| Property under construction     | 10,300    |\n| Owner-operated properties       | 231,827   |\n| Assets held for sale            | 539,084   |\n| Financial assets                | 83,560    |\n| Cash and cash equivalents       | 385,245   |\n| Fair value of other assets      | 99,810    |\n| Total assets                    | 3,762,678 |\n| Provisions                      | 1,111     |\n| Financial liabilities           | 1,374,383 |\n| Deferred tax liabilities        | 273,114   |\n| Liabilities held for sale       | 127,246   |\n| Fair value of other liabilities | 109,754   |\n| Total liabilities               | 1,885,608 |\n| Fair value net assets           | 1,877,070 |\n| Consideration                   | 682,393   |\n| Non-controlling interests       | 980,055   |\n| Badwill                         | -214,622  |\n\nThe resulting negative difference (badwill) of EUR -214.6 million was reported as part of the revaluation results from investment property and goodwill in 2022. This gain represented the difference between the net assets in S IMMO, valued in accordance with IFRS 3, as of the acquisition date on 27 December 2022 and the acquisition price for the controlling interest in S IMMO, which was derived from the market price plus a package \n\n{156}------------------------------------------------\n\npremium (also see section 4.6 for details on the valuation of the shares). The negative difference (badwill) resulted from a situation where the market price of S IMMO on the acquisition date was substantially lower than its equity valued in accordance with IFRS requirements. The recognition through profit or loss of this badwill was reported on the cash flow statement under other non-cash income and expenses, respectively reclassifications.\n\nNon-controlling interests were included on the basis of their share in the recognised assets and liabilities of S IMMO Group. No conditional consideration was agreed with the seller.\n\nThe standing investments were included in the consolidated financial statements of S IMMO Group in accordance with the fair value model defined in IAS 40 and, consequently, were already measured at fair value. The valuation of the standing investments was generally based on the discounted cash flow method applied by S IMMO Group (see section 4.1.1). Therefore, no adjustments were required to the fair value of the standing investments in connection with the initial consolidation.\n\nThe revaluation of the owner-operated properties, which primarily represent hotels operated by S IMMO Group, was based on fair value appraisals by the external experts at CBRE, Muhr & Wipfler and EHL. The revaluation in connection with the initial consolidation led to a gain of EUR 126.3 million.\n\nThe fair value of the bonds reported under financial liabilities was determined as the total future cash flows as of the acquisition date discounted with a DCF method. The future cash flows from the bonds were based on the agreed terms and underlying interest and repayment schedules. The interest rate curve used to discount the payment flows for the DCF calculation consisted of a risk-free basis curve and a premium for the risk of non-fulfilment (\"risk spread\"). The revaluation required in connection with the initial consolidation led to a reduction of EUR 41.3 million in financial liabilities.\n\nFurthermore, deferred taxes that were not recognised by S IMMO Group due to the initial recognition exemption were recognised as part of the business combination. The initial recognition exemption represents an exception under which a deferred tax liability or deferred tax asset is not recognised when it results from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability, when the underlying transaction is not a business combination, and when neither accounting nor profit before tax is influenced at the time of the transaction. The related adjustments totalled EUR 36.0 million.\n\nFor practical purposes, the consolidated income statement for 2022 did not include any components for S IMMO Group.

For subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments that prepare their financial statements in a foreign currency, the determination of the functional currency is based on the primary (macro)economic environment in which the respective company operates. A determining factor is the currency in which the majority of cash flows, goods and services are denominated and settled in the relevant country.\n\nWhen the functional currency of a subsidiary cannot be clearly identified, IAS 21 allows management to use its judgement to determine the functional currency that most faithfully represents the economic effects of the underlying transactions and events. Management has principally designated the euro as the functional currency for the subsidiaries in Romania, Poland, Czech Republic and Hungary; however, the local currency remains the functional currency for individual purchased property, service and management companies. This decision reflects the fact that macroeconomic developments in these countries are influenced by the eurozone. In addition, the leases concluded by IMMOFINANZ Group in these countries and real estate financing are generally denominated in the euro.\n\n#### 2.6.2 Translation of financial statements from foreign subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates\n\nIn accordance with IAS 21, the modified current rate method is used to translate the financial statements of the Group's subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates whose functional currency is not the euro. The assets and liabilities in the financial statements to be consolidated are translated at the mean exchange rate on the balance sheet date, while the income statement positions are translated at the weighted average exchange rate for the financial year.\n\nForeign currency translation is based on the exchange rates issued by the European Central Bank and by the respective national banks.\n\nThe following table lists the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date and the average exchange rates for the key currencies from IMMOFINANZ Group's viewpoint:\n\n| Currency | Closing rate on<br>31 12 2023 | Closing rate on<br>31 12 2022 | Average rate<br>2023 | Average rate<br>2022 |\n|----------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| BGN      | 1.95580                       | 1.95580                       | 1.95580              | 1.95580              |\n| CZK      | 24.72500                      | 24.11500                      | 23.98231             | 24.56192             |\n| HRK      | 7.53450                       | 7.53450                       | 7.53450              | 7.53520              |\n| HUF      | 382.78000                     | 400.25000                     | 382.05000            | 391.16154            |\n| PLN      | 4.34800                       | 4.68990                       | 4.54079              | 4.68145              |\n| RON      | 4.97460                       | 4.94740                       | 4.95165              | 4.93465              |\n| RSD      | 117.17370                     | 117.32240                     | 117.25147            | 117.47581            |\n| TRY      | 32.65310                      | 19.96490                      | 25.77431             | 17.28560             |\n\n{162}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-162-0\"></span>3. Information on Operating Segments\n\n## 3.1 Internal reporting\n\nThe chief operating decision-maker of IMMOFINANZ Group is the Executive Board. Internal reporting to the Executive Board is based on the classification of data into eight regional core markets (Austria, Germany, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Adriatic). Within the core markets, rental income is reported by asset class (office, retail and others) together with the income from the non-performance-related components of operating costs. Regions with a lower volume of business are aggregated under \"Other Countries\". S IMMO is reported as a separate operating segment The presentation of segment results is based on internal reporting to the Executive Board (management approach), whereby the statement of comprehensive income only includes IMMOFINANZ's continuing operations.\n\n## 3.2 Transition from operating segments to Group results\n\nThere are no material transactions between the segments which would affect profit or loss and, consequently, separate information is not provided on the elimination of intersegment amounts in the transition from revenues and profit or loss from the operating segments to the Group. Central services are allocated to the operating segments based on actual expenses. Service companies that only work for a particular segment are allocated to that segment. Transactions in real estate assets between the segments do not form a basis for decisions by the responsible chief operating decision-maker and, consequently, a transition is not provided for these transactions.\n\nInvestments in holding companies that cannot be assigned to a specific segment and non-operating subsidiaries are included in the transition column. This column also includes the elimination of immaterial intersegment transact.\n\n## 3.3 Information on reportable operating segments\n\nSegment assets consist primarily of investment properties, property under construction, goodwill, owner-operated properties, properties held for sale and real estate inventories. Segment investments include additions to investment property and property under construction as well as right-of-use assets as defined in IFRS 16. Liabilities are not allocated to the individual segments for internal reporting purposes.\n\nThe results of asset management and operating profit (EBIT) are used to assess performance and to allocate resources. The development of financial results and tax expense in the Group is managed centrally. Separate country boards, which report regularly to the chief operating decision-maker, were established for the core markets. EBIT in the \"total\" column reflects the same position on the consolidated income statement, which also shows the reconciliation to earnings before tax.\n\nThe accounting and valuation methods applied by the reportable segments comply with the accounting and valuation methods used to prepare IMMOFINANZ Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n{163}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 3.4 Regions as operating segments\n\nThe allocation of revenues and non-current assets to the individual regions is based on the location of the property.\n\n- Austria: The business segment Austria includes office buildings like the myhive location in the Ungargasse as well as the City Tower Vienna, which is classified as held for sale. The myhive am Wienerberg commercial and office center was sold to S IMMO in 2023 and is therefore reported under the S IMMO segment. This portfolio also includes individual retail properties under the STOP SHOP brand.\n- Germany: This portfolio includes the FLOAT office complex as well as the myhive Medienhafen Largo and Alto office properties.\n- Poland: Standing office investments represent a focal point for this segment. The major office locations include the Warsaw Spire, the myhive Park Postępu, the myhive IO-1 building and the myhive Nimbus Office in Warsaw.

Six properties were added in 2022 through the purchase of a retail portfolio from CPI Property Group\n- Czech Republic: The portfolio mix in the Czech Republic includes, among others, the Na Příkopě office property and the myhive Palmovka and myhive Pankrác House in Prague. Other important properties are the Olympia Pilsen Shopping Center which was acquired from CPI Property Group in 2023, the VIVO! Hostivař shopping center and retail parks under the STOP SHOP brand as well as retail properties which were acquired from CPI Property Group through package deals (2022: 30 properties, 2023: 22 properties).\n- Slovakia: The core business in Slovakia lies primarily in the retail asset class with the VIVO! Bratislava and the STOP SHOP retail parks as well as the 15 properties purchased from CPI Property Group in the fourth quarter of 2022. This portfolio also includes the myhive Vajnorská office property.\n- Hungary: Retail properties represent the focal point of this portfolio. In addition to STOP SHOP retail parks, this real estate portfolio was expanded by two additional retail properties through the purchase of a retail portfolio from CPI Property Group in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n- Romania: The business segment Romania covers retail properties such as the STOP SHOP Botosani retail park and the VIVO! Cluj-Napoca, VIVO! Constanta, VIVO! Baia Mare and VIVO! Pitești shopping centers. Also included are office properties like the myhive S-Park, myhive Metroffice and IRIDE Business Park as well as several properties in the Other asset class.\n- Adriatic: The property portfolio in the Adriatic region (Italy, Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia) includes STOP SHOP retail parks as well as various properties under construction and land. It also contains the Grand Centre Zagreb office building, which was sold in the first quarter of 2024, and one property in Croatia which is assigned to the Other asset class.\n- Other countries: Following the sale of land in Turkey (Other asset class) during 2023, there were no properties in this asset class as of 31 December 2023.\n- S IMMO: The increase in the investment in S IMMO AG to over 50% and the subsequent full consolidation of the shares led to the expansion of segment reporting at the end of 2022 to include the S IMMO sub-group. The S IMMO real estate portfolio includes office buildings, commercial properties, residential properties and hotels.\n\n## 3.5 Information on key customers\n\nIMMOFINANZ had no individual customers

Notes to the Consolidated Balance Sheet\n\n### 4.1 Investment property\n\nInvestment property includes land, buildings and/or parts of buildings that are held to generate rental income or for capital appreciation. The properties owned and operated by S IMMO Group (hotels) are reported under owner-operated properties. The space used by IMMOFINANZ is immaterial and is therefore included under investment property. Properties acquired at the start of the development process are classified as property under construction when the necessary decisions have been taken as of the acquisition date. In all other cases, real estate acquisitions are recognised as investment property.\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group filed applications for an immaterial amount of investment subsidies for investment property and property under construction (see section 0) in the Austrian companies during 2023. Investment subsidies are principally accounted for through a deduction to the acquisition cost when the asset is initially recognised (net method as per IAS 20.24).\n\n#### 4.1.1 Development of investment property\n\nDetails on the development of the fair value of investment property are presented in the following section. Foreign exchange differences resulting from the translation of foreign company assets at the rates in effect at the beginning and the end of the year are presented separately.\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                | 2023      | 2022      |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Beginning balance                                  | 7,707,196 | 4,736,375 |\n| Disposals following the sale of subsidiaries (2.5) | -75,646   | -95,379   |\n| Change in scope of consolidation                   | 821,079   | 2,412,852 |\n| Currency translation adjustments                   | -5,625    | 2,697     |\n| Additions                                          | 73,279    | 436,276   |\n| Disposals                                          | -187,999  | -39,427   |\n| Revaluation                                        | -353,154  | -97,573   |\n| Reclassifications                                  | 98,088    | 351,375   |\n| Reclassification from assets held for sale         | 9,400     | 0         |\n| Reclassification to assets held for sale           | -255,872  | 0         |\n| Ending balance                                     | 7,830,746 | 7,707,196 |\n\nThe development of investment property is as follows:\n\nDisposals following the sale of subsidiaries were related, above all, to land in Germany and Turkey as well as an office property in Croatia. The change in the scope of consolidation during 2023 resulted primarily from the purchase of office and retail properties in the Czech Republic and Hungary from CPI Property Group (see section 2.3). In 2022, this line included the properties held by S IMMO Group. The acquisitions principally represent investments in portfolio properties in the Czech Republic and Hungary by S IMMO. Also included here are purchases in Austria, Croatia and Romania, which cover acquisitions of EUR 51.4 million (2022: EUR 396.9 million) and subsequent investments of EUR 21.9 million (2022: EUR 39.3 million). The disposals of investment property in 2023 were related mainly to sales in Germany as well as the Bureau am Belvedere office building in Vienna. Reclassification to assets held for sale consisted, in particular, of properties in the Czech Republic and Germany, an office property and three retail properties in Austria, and two office properties in Bucharest (see section 4.10).\n\nThe reclassifications consisted mainly of transfers of investment property to property under construction (EUR -55.5 million; 2022: EUR -7.2 million) and from property under construction to investment property (EUR 139.4 million; 2022: EUR 356.9 million).\n\n{171}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### IFRS 16\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group leases real estate for rental to third parties (in particular building rights) and, to a lesser extent, leases buildings, land and other assets (autos and other items of business and operating equipment). The IFRS 16 rights of use resulting from the building rights are allocated to investment property. Information on the IFRS 16 rights of use related to owner-operated properties is provided in section 4.3, while information on the IFRS 16 rights of use included under other tangible assets can be found in section 4.4. For short-term leases (under 12 months) and low-value leases (under EUR 5,000), IMMOFINANZ Group applies the practical expedients defined by IFRS 16 and records the expenses for these contracts under other operating expenses (see section 5.6). The option to waive the separation of lease and non-lease components was not applied.\n\nThe rights of use for investment property and property under construction are subsequently measured at fair value in accordance with IAS 40 (see section 5.8 for the valuation effect) and represent the respective lease liabilities as of the measurement date (see section 4.14). Lease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost with the application of the effective interest method and include any foreign exchange increases or decreases (see section 5.10). Lease payments on the rights of use for building rights are normally indexed and, consequently, regularly represent the current market price. As a rule, the leases for building rights do not include any purchase options.\n\nThe rights of use included under investment property totalled EUR 55.3 million as of 31 December 2023 (2022: EUR 57.3 million). No rights of use were reclassified to assets held for sale in 2023 (see section 4.10). Information on the lessor's accounting treatment is provided in section 5.1.1.\n\n#### 4.1.2 Accounting policies\n\nThe fair value of the standing investments held by IMMOFINANZ as of 31 December 2023 and in the previous year was generally determined with the so-called hardcore and top-slice version of the investment method.\n\nUnder the hardcore and top-slice version, the net income generated by a property – up to the market rent (the so-called hardcore component) – is capitalised at a normal market interest rate as a perpetual yield over the entire term (term of the rental contract plus subsequent rental). The top-slice component (i.e. the net income that exceeds or falls below the market rent) is then discounted at a risk-adjusted market interest rate if necessary. The amount of the risk premium is dependent on the probability of vacancy.\n\nIn the S IMMO segment, the discounted cash flow method (DCF method) is used to value the standing investments in Germany and the Czech Republic. Quantitative information on the parameters used for valuation is provided in section 4.1.3.\n\nThe valuation of undeveloped land held by IMMOFINANZ Group is based on a comparable value method. This method uses the realised purchase prices from other sites with a similar location and size to determine the value of the target property.\n\nProperties under development and investment properties that were acquired for possible redesign and renovation (redevelopment) are measured with the residual value method in IMMOFINANZ Group. The appraiser is responsible for selecting the valuation method. Differences to the above-mentioned procedure are therefore possible.\n\nChanges in the fair value of investment properties, properties under construction, properties held for sale and properties sold are recognised to profit or loss and reported on the income statement under revaluation (see section 5.8). On property sales, the difference between the carrying amount on the last closing date and the last quarter prior to the sale is recorded under valuation results from standing investments, respectively property under construction; the difference between the carrying amount in the last quarter and the sale proceeds is reported under the results of property sales (see section 5.3).\n\nThe accounting for investment property in accordance with the fair value model requires regular revaluation. In IMMOFINANZ Group, effectively all properties are valued by independent appraisers in accordance with the recommendations of the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA).\n\n{172}------------------------------------------------\n\nCBRE served as the appraiser for most of the properties held by IMMOFINANZ Group as of 31 December 2023. Cushman & Wakefield (Slovakia) and iO Partners (Hungary) were responsible for additional appraisals. A very limited number of internal valuations were also carried out.\n\nThe valuations by these external appraisers are based on their market knowledge and the inspection of the properties as well as supplied information, e.g. rental lists, rental contracts, land register excerpts and maintenance and investment budgets. This data is reviewed by the appraisers, who verify its plausibility through comparisons with market data. The experts also make estimates, among others, for the occupancy, future rental income, scheduled investments and expected returns. This process is accompanied by the members of IM-MOFINANZ Group's asset management and controlling staffs. The results of the property valuation process are reviewed by internal experts in IMMOFINANZ Group for plausibility and coordinated with the Executive Board.\n\nAn IMMOFINANZ Group guideline and the contract concluded with the appraiser require the inspection of all properties as part of the initial valuation. Starting with the first follow-up valuation, the appraisers are required to inspect at least 10% of the properties in each country of their assigned portfolio and to examine all newly acquired properties each year. The on-site inspection of the property by the appraiser may not be older than three years.\n\nIn IMMOFINANZ Group, the properties are appraised for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements as of 31 December and, in part, also for the preparation of the consolidated interim financial statements as of 30 June. Internal valuations are carried out for the preparation of the interim financial statements as of 31 March and 30 September.\n\n#### 4.1.3 Valuation assumptions and existing valuation uncertainty\n\nIFRS 13 requires the classification of assets and liabilities measured at fair value in three fair value hierarchy levels based on the determining input factors. All investment properties are classified under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because of the various parameters used in property valuation that are not directly or indirectly observable on the market (see the following table for information on the most important non-observable input factors).\n\nThe classes are defined according to the respective characteristics, features and risks associated with the assets. The allocation criteria include the business segments and asset classes (office, retail and others). The office, retail and others asset classes are aggregated into country groups based on specific homogeneity criteria: West (Austria, Germany), CEE (Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania) and Other Countries (Italy, Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia).\n\nThis aggregation results in the following classes:\n\n- Office in each of the country groups West, CEE, Other Countries\n- Retail in each of the country groups West, CEE, Other Countries\n- Other in each of the country groups West, CEE, Other Countries\n\nThe following table shows the input factors used for valuation and lists the key input parameters for each class of standing investments. A minimum and maximum value is shown for each input parameter in the class; consequently, the various parameters are generally not related to the same property. In addition to the minimum and maximum amounts, a weighted average and median amount are provided for each input parameter within the individual classes.\n\nThe input parameters presented in the following tables for 2023 and 2022 are to be understood as follows:\n\n– Lettable space in sqm: the total gross space available for rental by tenants (excluding parking areas)\n\n- Market rent per sqm and month in EUR: the appraiser's estimate of the monthly rent for which a property could be rented by knowledgeable and willing parties under appropriate conditions and without compulsion in an arm's length transaction\n- Actual net rent per sqm and month in EUR: the monthly rent in square metres based on expected rents for the first year after the deduction of costs carried by the renter\n\n{173}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Capitalisation rate in %: yield based on the expected income from the property; the exit yield is reported for\n- properties held by the S IMMO Group which are valued according to the DCF method\n- Vacancy rate in %: the actual vacancy rate as of the balance sheet date.\n\nDepending on the estimates of risk – which are based, in general, on the asset class, the country and current market circumstances and, in particular, on the condition of the building, its location and occupancy rate – different interest rates are applied to the individual properties. The assumptions underlying the valuation, e.g. for market rents, rental default risks, vacancies or maintenance costs, are based on market assessments, on derived data or on the appraisers' experience. Comparable rental contracts and property transactions on the market are regularly monitored, filed and evaluated by the appraisers. These market benchmarks are then transferred to the target properties and estimates for future rents or a potential market price, in the event of a sale, are calculated.\n\nThe following tables also include the investment property classified held for sale (see section 4.10), in cases where current appraisals were available as of the balance sheet date.\n\n| Office<br>2023  |                  |

are heavily dependent on the input factors underlying the valuation. For example: a change in the assumed rental income from a property or in the capitalisation rate has a direct effect on the fair value of the property and, in turn, on the revaluation results reported by IMMOFINANZ Group. Therefore, the derived fair values are directly related to the underlying parameters. Even minor changes in the economic or property-specific assumptions used for valuation can have a significant influence on IMMOFINANZ Group's earnings.\n\nThe following table shows the per cent change in the fair value of investment property as of 31 December 2023 that would have resulted from changes in market rents and interest rates:\n\n| Sensitivity of fair value as of 31 December 2023 IMMOFINANZ Group |             |           | Interest rate |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------|---------------|\n| Market rent                                                       | Δ -0.25 bps | Δ 0.0 bps | Δ +0.25 bps   |\n| Δ -5.0%                                                           | -1.2%       | -5.0%     | -8.5%         |\n| Δ 0.0%                                                            | 4.0%        | 0.0%      | -3.7%         |\n| Δ +5.0%                                                           | 9.2%        | 5.0%      | 1.1%          |\n\n1 Capitalisation rate\n\nFor example: if the interest rate fell by 0.25 basis points and market rents remained unchanged, the fair value of IMMOFINANZ Group's investment property would increase by 4.0%.\n\nThe above data are based on the properties in the standing investment portfolio, which were valued by external appraisers according to the hardcore and top slice or DCF method. Rights of use classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 and properties under construction are excluded. The investment property held by IMMOFINANZ Group had a carrying amount of EUR 7,830.7 million as of 31 December 2023. Of this total, the carrying amount of the portfolio properties which flowed into the sensitivity analysis equalled EUR 7,580.3 million, or 97% of the standing investment portfolio.\n\nThe following two tables show the per cent change in the fair value of investment property as of 31 December 2022 that would have resulted from changes in rental income and interest rates. The data is presented separately for the properties owned by IMMOFINANZ and the S IMMO Group:\n\n| Sensitivity of fair value as of 31 December 2022 IMMOFINANZ |          |        | Rental income |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|---------------|\n| Interest rate1                                              | Δ -10.0% | Δ 0.0% | Δ +10.0%      |\n| Δ -10.0%                                                    | -0.7%    | 11.5%  | 23.7%         |\n| Δ 0.0%                                                      | -11.0%   | 0.0%   | 11.0%         |\n| Δ +10.0%                                                    | -19.4%   | -9.4%  | 0.5%          |\n\n1 Capitalisation rate\n\nThe above data are based on the top 30 properties in the standing investment portfolio, which are defined as the 30 properties with the highest carrying amount. Properties classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 are excluded. As of 31 December 2022, the investment property held by IMMOFINANZ Group had a carrying amount of EUR 7,707.2 million, whereby EUR 5,050.2 million are attributable to IMMOFINANZ and EUR 2,657.0 million to S IMMO. The carrying amount of the top 30 properties in the IMMOFINANZ property portfolio totalled EUR 2,893.6 million as of 31 December 2022, or 57.3% of the standing investment portfolio. The carrying amount of the top 30 properties in the S IMMO Group property portfolio as of 31 December 2022 totalled EUR 1,656.6 million or 62.4% of the standing investment portfolio.\n\n| Sensitivity of fair value as of 31 December 2022: S IMMO |          |        | Rental income |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|---------------|\n| Interest rate1                                           | Δ -10.0% | Δ 0.0% | Δ +10.0%      |\n| Δ -10.0%                                                 | 1.0%     | 11.1%  | 21.0%         |\n| Δ 0.0%                                                   | -10.2%   | 0.0%   | 9.9%          |\n| Δ +10.0%                                                 | -19.4%   | -9.3%  | 0.6%          |\n\n1 Capitalisation rate\n\nIn addition to the previously discussed valuation-relevant input parameters, changes in exchange rates also have an effect on profit or loss through revaluation results. Interest rate fluctuations no longer have a material \n\n{181}------------------------------------------------\n\neffect on the valuation of investment properties since the functional currency in all core countries is the euro and only a few non-core countries have a different functional currency. The sensitivity analysis for this input parameter was therefore discontinued.\n\n#### 4.1.4 Concentration risk\n\nConcentration risk is understood to mean the accumulation of similar risks that contradict the principle of risk diversification. IMMOFINANZ Group consciously reduces these risks through the sector and regional diversification of its property portfolio. In addition to sector and regional factors, the diversification of the tenant structure represents another focal point and is designed to prevent the loss of a tenant from significantly influencing the company. IMMOFINANZ Group has a well-balanced and varied tenant mix. No single tenant is responsible for more than 2.5% of total rental income (also see section 3.5).\n\n#### 4.1.5 Climate risks\n\nThe real estate sector is responsible for roughly one-third of global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Major efforts are therefore directed to reducing this component through new regulations. IMMOFINANZ Group has gone to great lengths in recent years to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from its portfolio. Over the coming years, the company plans to increase its focus on measures to improve energy efficiency. The energy efficiency of buildings – together with energy generation – also plays a central role in the EU Taxonomy Regulation. For this reason, IMMOFINANZ Group has been installing photovoltaic equipment on its properties and plans to continue doing so in the coming years. This important contribution to decarbonisation is an integral part of the company's ESG strategy.\n\nIn the area of climate risks, modelling shows a stronger increase in the temperatures in IMMOFINANZ Group's core markets as well as a greater probability of longer dry periods. Both of these trends are integrated in building refurbishment projects and flow into project development analyses. Properties near the coasts in Poland and Croatia – and here, only a limited number of retail parks are involved – are exposed to the risk of rising sea levels. Natural hazards represent a further aspect since the models forecast an increasing danger of forest fires due to the longer dry periods. This phenomenon is already visible in the Mediterranean region and will spread northward in the coming years. The related risks are addressed with construction measures that include a focus on the design and expansion of green areas and, in addition, all IMMOFINANZ Group properties are insured against natural hazards. The properties owned and operated by IMMOFINANZ Group are not exposed to a high overall climate risk and, therefore, there are no indications of a possible loss in value or a need to adjust the useful life.\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group also sees opportunities in the area of biodiversity. Future plans include the replacement of water-intensive grassy areas with planting that supports biodiversity. These areas not only save water and energy but require less care and can help to achieve a slight reduction in operating costs.\n\nBased on the four pillars of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and in accordance with the requirements of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, IMMOFINANZ Group carried out climate risk analyses for all its properties in 2022 and 2023.\n\nSustainability and environmental aspects also represent an integral part of the approach to the valuation of real estate, for investment property as well as owner-operated property. The term sustainability is understood to include factors such as the environment and climate change, health and wellbeing as well as the entrepreneurial responsibilities that can or could influence the valuation of a property. In a valuation context, sustainability covers a broad spectrum of physical, social, ecological and economic factors that could influence value.\n\nThe spectrum ranges from fundamental environmental risks like flooding, energy efficiency and climate to issues involving design, furnishings, accessibility, legal regulations, management and tax considerations as well as current and historical space utilisation. Sustainability also has an influence on the value of a property, even if it is not explicitly mentioned in the appraisal.\n\nThe effects of sustainability on a valuation reflect the appraiser's understanding as to how market participants include sustainability factors in their offers and the influence of these factors on the market's valuation. Sustainability criteria or ESG ratings have an increasing influence on the value of properties, above all through \n\n{182}------------------------------------------------\n\nrealisable rents and the capitalisation rate that reflects the risks inherent in an investment. These market factors are closely monitored by the appraisers and incorporated in their valuations.\n\nSome appraisers also draw on their own studies and analyses to identify and understand market trends. These studies and analyses also supply comparative data for the rents and prices realisable in the respective market segment which, also in the context of sustainability and environmental aspects, are the most important input factors for valuation.\n\nBased on the regular monitoring of the behaviour of market participants by the appraisers and ESG-specific information on the individual properties, the appraisers adjust the estimate for market rents, vacancy periods and capitalisation rates.\n\nAn increasing readiness to include premiums for green buildings is already visible among both tenants and investors. These premiums are still relatively low but are expected to increase substantially in the coming years because of the higher discounts on rents and prices for brown buildings.\n\nClimate risks can change the market interest rates or rents which flow into valuation, depending on their development. They can also lead to a situation where green financing, e.g. the issued green bonds, are not available or only available under less advantageous conditions.\n\nS IMMO is currently using several green bonds to finance and refinance projects that are aligned with its sustainable bond framework. This framework follows the Green Bond and Social Bond Principles of the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) and requires the use of proceeds solely for green buildings, energy efficiency, renewable energy and/or affordable housing. At the present time, all financed projects are assigned and allocated to green building-certified properties.\n\nNo climate risks have been identified to date which would have required the recognition of provisions or the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Moreover, the reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption set by S IMMO as part of its corporate ESG strategy have no concrete effects on the financial statements.\n\nIn this connection it should be noted that ESG measures and investments have a positive influence on rents and possibly also on lower operating costs or costs that cannot be passed on to tenants. This effect does not have an equal impact on the value of the respective property over the short term. These types of investments, however, counteract a future decline in rents and prevent a property from classification as a \"stranded asset\" in an increasingly sensitive market due to an unfavourable ESG rating.\n\nClimate risks currently have no material influence on the consolidated financial statements of IMMOFINANZ Group.\n\n{183}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 4.2 Property under construction\n\nProperty under construction includes the properties under development as well as standing investments which were reclassified over time from standing investments to property under construction due to refurbishment or redevelopment. IMMOFINANZ views refurbishment and renovation as the structural-technical restoration or modernisation of one or more floors, the communal areas or an entire property to improve the overall standard. Above all, it involves preserving the value of the building substance and/or modernising the property to improve its potential. This involves the facade as well as the building core (floors, rental areas, communal areas, plant rooms etc.). Major renovation extends beyond normal maintenance and repairs and beyond a maintenance backlog. An important criterion for classification as renovation is the investment volume and a reduced occupancy level. A major renovation project is, as a rule, considered to exist when the investment volume equals or exceeds 10% of the property's current fair value and the occupancy rate has fallen below 50%.\n\nProperty under construction is reclassified to investment property when the development measures are finalised and the project is completed. This completion includes the transfer of general contractor activities, transfer to the asset management process and the approval of the Executive Board.\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of assets whose purchase or development requires a substantial period of time are generally capitalised as part of the acquisition or production cost. In accordance with IAS 23, the application of this accounting procedure is not mandatory if the acquired or developed assets are measured at fair value. Since IMMOFINANZ has elected to use the fair value model for the subsequent measurement of investment property (see section 1.2), borrowing costs are not capitalised on property accounted for according to IAS 40. The capitalisation of interest on construction financing according to IAS 23 was immaterial for S IMMO Group in 2023 and 2022.\n\nThe development of property under construction is shown in the following table:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                | 2023    | 2022     |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|\n| Beginning balance                                  | 198,500 | 474,311  |\n| Disposals following the sale of subsidiaries (2.5) | -1,025  | 0        |\n| Change in scope of consolidation                   | 0       | 10,300   |\n| Currency translation adjustments                   | 0       | -68      |\n| Additions                                          | 47,963  | 99,681   |\n| Disposals                                          | -2,100  | -30,343  |\n| Revaluation                                        | -20,792 | -9,180   |\n| Reclassifications                                  | -79,586 | -346,201 |\n| Ending balance                                     | 142,960 | 198,500  |\n\nThe change in the scope of consolidation in 2022 is attributable to properties under construction by S IMMO Group. The additions are related chiefly to development projects for the STOP SHOP brand in Croatia and Serbia as well as investments at myhive locations in Austria and Romania. The disposals in 2022 involved an office property in Austria. Revaluation results were influenced primarily by development projects for the myhive brand in Poland, Austria and Romania.\n\nThe reclassifications involve, above all, transfers of from investment property to property under construction (EUR -55.0 million; 2022: EUR -7.2 million) and transfers from property under construction to investment property (EUR 139.4 million; 2022: EUR 356.9 million).\n\nThe residual value method is generally used to value property under construction. Standing investments that were transferred to property under construction due to upcoming refurbishment or upgrading are valued as standing investments until detailed redevelopment plans are available. As soon as these plans are available, valuation is based on the residual value method. Residual value is understood to represent the amount remaining after the deduction of all project development costs and the imputed project development profit (developer profit) from the property's estimated market price after completion. The unrealised imputed project development profit declines with the progress on the project. The most important input factors for this valuation \n\n{184}------------------------------------------------\n\nmethod are the future rental income from the project, the discount rate (these two parameters generally determine the estimated fair value on completion) and the outstanding project development costs. The capitalisation rates for IMMOFINANZ Group's development projects range from 6.5% to 8.85% (2022: 4.3% to 8.25%), while the project development profit ranges from 5.0% to 17.5% (2022: 2.0% to 6.0%). The estimated fair values of the projects on completion range from EUR 9.3 million to EUR 108.9 million (2022: EUR 9.6 million to EUR 110.1 million), and the estimated outstanding construction costs by project from EUR 6.3 million to EUR 78.0 million (2022: EUR 3.9 million to EUR 78.3 million).\n\nInformation on other parameters relevant for valuation and on valuation uncertainty is provided in section 4.1.3.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, property under construction included rights of use totalling EUR 4.9 million (2022: EUR 0.0 million). No rights of use had been reclassified to assets held for sale as of that date (2022: EUR 0.0 million) (see section 4.10).\n\n### 4.3 Owner-operated properties\n\nOwner-operated properties represent hotels owned by S IMMO Group (first consolidated in 2022), which were recognised at fair value the consolidated financial statements. These hotels are operated by the owner, generally in the form of management contracts, which means the occupancy risk lies with IMMOFINANZ Group. These types of hotels are not covered by the scope of application of IAS 40 but are accounted for as property, plant and equipment in accordance with IAS 16. Owner-operated properties are measured in accordance with the revaluation model defined by IAS 16. They are carried at the respective revaluation amounts, which represent fair value on the revaluation date less subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated write-downs. If these owner-operated properties were valued at cost, depreciated cost would have equalled EUR 97.5 million as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 104.3 million).\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                          | 2023    | 2022    |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Fair value - beginning balance               | 230,600 | 0       |\n| Additions through business combinations      | 0       | 230,600 |\n| Additions                                    | 261     | 0       |\n| Disposals                                    | -99     | 0       |\n| Depreciation                                 | -13,441 | 0       |\n| Impairment/Reversals of impairment           | -1,825  | 0       |\n| Revaluation                                  | 13,005  | 0       |\n| Currency translation adjustments             | 0       | 0       |\n| Fair value - ending balance                  | 228,500 | 230,600 |\n| Accumulated depreciation - beginning balance | 0       | 0       |\n| Depreciation                                 | -13,441 | 0       |\n| Impairment/Reversals of impairment           | -1,825  | 0       |\n| Currency translation adjustments             | 0       | 0       |\n| Accumulated depreciation - ending balance    | -15,266 | 0       |\n\nThe discounted cash flow method (DCF method) was used to determine fair value. CBRE and Cushman & Wakefield were responsible for the fair value measurement of the owner-operated properties. Similar to investment properties, owner-operated properties are assigned to Level 3 on the fair value hierarchy (see section 4.1 for details on the valuation). The rentable space in the owner-operated properties held by IM-MOFINANZ Group ranges from 13,798 to 27,600 sqm (31 December 2022: 13,798 to 27,646 sqm), the net realisable rent per sqm and month from EUR 11.40 to EUR 24.70 (31 December 2022: EUR 5.03 to EUR 23.64), and the capitalisation rate from 7.65% to 9.80% (31 December 2022: 7.15% to 9.00%).\n\n{185}------------------------------------------------\n\nLeases as defined in IFRS 16 also cover buildings used by the owner. The resulting rights of use are reported under \"owner-operated properties\" and totalled EUR 1.1 million as of 31 December 2023 (2022: EUR 1.2 million). These rights of use are amortised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\n## 4.4 Other tangible assets\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, other tangible assets included IFRS 16 rights of use totalling EUR 0.5 million (2022: EUR 0.9 million).\n\n## 4.5 Intangible assets\n\n#### 4.5.1 Composition of intangible assets\n\nThe carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets is shown in the following table:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR     | 31 12 2023 | 31 12 2022 |\n|-------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Goodwill                | 19,312     | 19,530     |\n| Other intangible assets | 1,235      | 886        |\n| Total                   | 20,547     | 20,416     |\n\n{186}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 4.5.2 Goodwill\n\nThe development of goodwill is shown in the following table:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                          | 2023     | 2022     |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Acquisition cost - beginning balance         | 278,872  | 283,215  |\n| Disposals following the sale of subsidiaries | -63,239  | -4,337   |\n| Currency translation adjustments             | 0        | -6       |\n| Acquisition cost - ending balance            | 215,633  | 278,872  |\n| Accumulated depreciation - beginning balance | -259,342 | -259,283 |\n| Disposals following the sale of subsidiaries | 63,196   | 236      |\n| Currency translation adjustments             | -1       | 5        |\n| Impairment losses to continuing operations   | -174     | -300     |\n| Accumulated depreciation - ending balance    | -196,321 | -259,342 |\n| Carrying amount as of the balance sheet date | 19,312   | 19,530   |\n\nGoodwill regularly results as a technical figure when the acquisition of a subsidiary represents a business combination as defined in IFRS 3 and does not result in another acquisition (see section 2.2.2) because of the obligation to recognise deferred taxes on the difference between the fair value and the tax base of the acquired real estate assets. This goodwill is tested for indications of impairment each year. IMMOFINANZ determines the recoverable amount based on fair value less costs to sell and not according to the value in use, whereby it is normally assumed that net yields above the market level are not sustainable on real estate markets.\n\nThe cash-generating units generally represent individual properties or property portfolios. Due to the extensive number of properties held by IMMOFINANZ, the carrying amount of goodwill is aggregated by segments for presentation (see section 3.6).\n\nThe recoverable amount of the cash-generating units is based on the fair value of the included properties as determined by an expert opinion and includes the deferred taxes that are not transferrable to a hypothetical buyer as well as costs to sell. If the hypothetical transaction underlying the determination of the recoverable amount is assumed to be structured in a way that does not change the tax base of the assets – which is regularly the case with share deals –the deferred tax liabilities would be implicitly included in the recoverable amount at zero. Experience from recent transactions has shown that the determination of the selling price through negotiations generally leads to an equal allocation of the deferred tax liabilities between the seller and the buyer.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is then compared with the carrying amount of the included properties plus any goodwill and minus the deferred tax liabilities attributable to the respective properties. Deferred taxes are included in accordance with IAS 36 because these items are implicitly included in the determination of the recoverable amount.\n\nInformation on property valuation and the related estimation uncertainty is provided in sections 4.1.2 and 4.1.3. The selling costs for IMMOFINANZ are estimated at 0.5% to 2.0% of the respective property value and result primarily from brokerage services and legal advising.\n\nThe key valuation-relevant input parameters as of 31 December 2023 for properties that carry goodwill are summarised in the following table, classified by segments:\n\n{187}------------------------------------------------\n\n|

Together with the 19,499,437 shares previously held, this represents an investment of 50% plus one share in S IMMO and gives IMMOFINANZ a controlling influence over S IMMO. S IMMO was therefore reclassified from associates to fully consolidated subsidiaries as of that date. Due to the materiality of this transaction for an understanding of the consolidated financial statements, the relevant disclosures from the 2022 consolidated financial statements are repeated here.\n\nIn the transition consolidation, the previously held shares in S IMMO were considered part of the acquisition costs for the fully consolidated company and were measured at fair value. The absence of Level 1 fair values for the share package (unit of account), which represents a comparable capital interest, required a decision on the estimation method used to value the shares. IFRS do not provide any explicit rules for determining the fair value of such valuation objects in accordance with IFRS 13. The management of IMMOFINANZ Group decided to carry out these valuations as \"close to market\" as possible. The price on the Vienna Stock Exchange as of 31 December 2022, plus a package premium, therefore formed the basis for valuation. IFRS 13 permits the inclusion of premiums under the following conditions: when the premium reflects the economic characteristics \n\n{189}------------------------------------------------\n\nof the valuation object; when hypothetical buyers would include the premium in determining a purchase price; and when the inclusion of a premium does not contradict the unit of account (in this case, the equity-accounted investment in S IMMO).\n\nThe package premium was derived from comparable transactions (the purchase of capital investments in European companies from 2013 to 2022) based on capital market data. The premium for a share package with significant influence equalled 17.9% as of 31 December 2022. The fair value of the investment in S IMMO as of 31 December 2022 was based on a package premium derived from comparable transactions and increased to 41.8% to reflect the takeover situation. This was specifically based on the expiration of the extension period for the takeover process and on the fact that CPI Property Group failed to attain a majority holding of more than 90% of the shares and was therefore unable to execute a squeeze-out. Since the fair value was ultimately derived from observable and non-observable data, it is classified under Level 3 in accordance with IFRS 13.\n\nThe fair value of the share package was therefore based on the market price of EUR 12.48 per share plus a package premium of EUR 101.6 million (EUR 5.21 per share) and totalled EUR 344.9 million (EUR 17.69 per share). Since the carrying amount of the investment equalled EUR 537.2 million as of 31 December 2022, this led to the recognition of an impairment loss of EUR -192.2 million, which was recorded under equity-accounted investments and reported under the Austria segment.\n\nThe share of profit or loss from the equity-accounted investments also included the recycling of other comprehensive income from foreign exchange translation and the change in the hedge accounting reserve at a total of EUR 12.9 million.\n\nThe income statement for the 2022 financial year included the share of profit or loss from the equity valuation of S IMMO. This share of profit or loss included the proportional share of results for the period as well as the proportional share of results recognised in OCI based on the consolidated financial statements of S IMMO for 2022. Since the at-equity valuation of the S IMMO investment in 2021 was based in part on forecast data, the calculation also included the difference between the share of results recorded in the previous year based on this forecast data and the share of actual results that would have followed if actual data had been available in 2021.\n\nIAS 28.40 requires a company that applies the equity method, including the recognition of the associate's losses, to determine whether there are any objective indications of significant or lasting impairment to its net investment in the associate. Since the associates are not listed, the impairment test was based on qualitative criteria. An impairment loss of EUR -5.5 million was recognised to an investment in associates as of 31 December 2023 and is reported under other adjustments in the following table.\n\nThe following table provides aggregated financial information on the associates, including a reconciliation to the carrying amounts and shares of profit or loss reported in IMMOFINANZ Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n{190}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### IMMOFINANZ GROUP Annual Financial Report 2023\n\n|

Individual valuation adjustments are recognised for receivables that carry an increased risk of default. Consequently, all uncollectible receivables had been written off and all doubtful receivables had been adjusted through valuation adjustments as of the balance sheet date. These valuation adjustments are included in the results of asset management and are not reported on a separate line on the income statement, as required by IAS 1.82, because the related amounts are not considered material.\n\nValuation adjustments (resp. revaluations) to trade and other receivables are reported on the income statement under the write-off of receivables from asset management, which represent part of the expenses from investment property (see section 5.1.3), or under miscellaneous expenses as part of other operating expenses (see section 5.6).\n\nThe valuation adjustments to trade and other receivables totalled EUR -0.1 million in 2023 (2022: EUR -17.3 million). Detailed information on the change in impairment and default risk is provided in section 7.2.2.\n\n{193}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 4.8 Other financial assets\n\nOther non-current financial instruments include derivatives and miscellaneous securities as shown below:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR              | 31 12 2023 | 31 12 2022 |\n|----------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Other securities                 | 16,785     | 15,335     |\n| Derivative financial instruments | 147,585    | 235,983    |\n| Total                            | 164,371    | 251,318    |\n\nThe other securities consist of investments in companies. These investments include EUR 8.1 million (31 December 2022: EUR 7.6 million) carried at fair value through profit or loss and EUR 8.7 million (31 December 2022: EUR 7.3 million) at fair value through other comprehensive income. The convertible bond reported as of 31 December 2022 at an amount of EUR 0.4 million was carried at fair value through profit or loss and was converted in 2023.\n\nDerivatives are accounted for as stand-alone financial instruments and are used to reduce the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. Derivative transactions are only concluded with financial institutions that have first-rate credit standings. Derivatives are carried at fair value through profit or loss as of the balance sheet date.

These temporary differences are calculated by comparing the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements with the respective tax bases at the subsidiary level. Deferred taxes are recognised when the existing differences are expected to reverse in the future. With regard to the differences arising from the fair value measurement of investment property (see section 4.1), it is generally assumed that the temporary differences will reverse when the property is sold.\n\nDeferred taxes are not recognised for temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or a liability from a transaction which does not represent a business combination as defined in IFRS 3 and which does not influence pre-tax earnings or taxable income on the transaction date. This applies, above all, to the acquisition of property companies that are not classified as business combinations in the sense of IFRS 3 (see section 2.2.2).\n\n{194}------------------------------------------------\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are not recognised for temporary differences resulting from shares in subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates (outside-basis differences) in cases where their reversal can be controlled by IM-MOFINANZ Group and is not probable in the foreseeable future. For this reason, deferred tax liabilities were not recognised for temporary differences of EUR 1,980.9 million in 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 3,066.1 million).\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised on tax loss carryforwards when it is probable that sufficient taxable income will be available to utilise these tax loss carryforwards in the future. Deferred tax assets are also recorded in cases where sufficient deferred tax liabilities relating to the same tax subject and taxation authority were recognised and are assumed to reverse at the same time as the deferred tax assets on the unused loss carryforwards.\n\nThe recognition of deferred tax assets, in general, and deferred taxes on unused tax loss carryforwards and deductible temporary partial depreciation charges on investments (\"Siebentelabschreibung\"), in particular, is based on expectations by IMMOFINANZ Group's management concerning the availability of sufficient taxable profits in the future. These expectations reflect the previous history of tax losses, limits on the utilisation of tax losses, membership in a tax group and the possible expiration of tax loss carryforwards in some countries. Accounting decisions over the recognition or recoverability of deferred taxes are based, on the one hand, on the latest data from tax planning over a five-year forecast period and, on the other hand, on assumptions for the timing of the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and the availability of tax planning opportunities to utilise previously unused tax losses in Austria and other countries.\n\nThe recoverability of deferred tax assets by Group companies that recorded losses in 2023 or 2022 (EUR 6.6 million; 2022: EUR 2.6 million) is dependent on the generation of future taxable profits that are higher than the earnings effect from the reversal of the existing taxable temporary differences.\n\nThe following table shows the loss carryforwards for which deferred tax assets were not recognised. These tax loss carryforwards can generally be carried forward for an unlimited period unless designated as \"expiry\". Deferred tax assets were not recognised for deductible temporary partial depreciation charges on investments (\"Siebentelabschreibung\") of EUR 114.5 million (31 December 2022: EUR 114.8 million).\n\n| Country                        | Tax rate       | Loss carryfor<br>wards not recog<br>nised 31 12 2023 | thereof expiry<br>within 1–5 years | Loss carryfor<br>wards not recog<br>nised 31 12 2022 |\n|--------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Austria                        | 23.00%         | 1,735,081                                            | 0                                  | 2,146,903                                            |\n| Germany (corporate income tax) | 15.83%         | 362,938                                              | 0                                  | 345,278                                              |\n| Germany (trade tax)            | 14,35%–16,625% | 374,808                                              | 0                                  | 361,581                                              |\n| Poland                         | 9.00%–19.00%   | 14,789                                               | 10,248                             | 29,626                                               |\n| Romania                        | 16.00%         | 39,878                                               | 97                                 | 28,133                                               |\n| Slovakia                       | 21.00%         | 3,500                                                | 3,500                              | 2,905                                                |\n| Czech Republic                 | 21.00%         | 7,116                                                | 7,116                              | 0                                                    |\n| Hungary                        | 9.00%          | 35,900                                               | 20,966                             | 30,365                                               |\n| Croatia                        | 10.00%–18.00%  | 29                                                   | 29                                 | 1,196                                                |\n| Serbia                         | 15.00%         | 86                                                   | 86                                 | 34                                                   |\n| Bulgaria                       | 10.00%         | 19,843                                               | 19,843                             | 13,907                                               |\n| Netherlands                    | 19.00%–25.80%  | 1,610                                                | 1,610                              | 6,552                                                |\n| Total                          |                | 2,595,578                                            | 63,495                             | 2,966,480                                            |\n\nThe calculation of deferred taxes is based on the tax rate that is expected to apply when the temporary differences are presumed to reverse.

The guideline required implementation by the EU member states into national law by 31 December 2023 with enactment as of 1 January 2024. This directive was implemented into national law by most of the EU member states in 2023 with an effective date of 1 January 2024.\n\nThe takeover of IMMOFINANZ AG and S IMMO AG by CPI Property Group S.A. resulted in total revenues that exceeded the threshold of EUR 750 million. IMMOFINANZ AG and the IMMOFINANZ Group companies are therefore subject to the provisions of this EU Directive, respectively local minimum tax laws. CPI Property Group S.A. is the ultimate parent company of IMMOFINANZ AG and the IMMOFINANZ Group companies.\n\nHowever, IMMOFINANZ AG is classified as a parent company in part ownership because over 20% of its shares are held by parties outside the Group. IMMOFINANZ AG is therefore subject to the provisions of the Minimum Tax Reform Act on the low-taxed business units under its control and is required to pay a minimum tax in Austria.\n\nAll major countries (with the exception of Poland) where IMMOFINANZ Group is active have enacted national tax regulations for minimum taxation in accordance with the EU directive which took effect at the end of 2022. These countries have implemented the regulations through a national top-up tax that takes effect as of 1 January 2024. It is expected that top-up tax will be chargeable to the IMMOFINANZ Group companies in Hungary (9%), Cyprus (12.5%), Croatia (10%, resp. 18%), Poland (9%, resp. 19%) and Bulgaria (10%) because the applicable nominal tax rates in these countries are currently below 15%. It is also expected that, in the end, a national top-up tax will be introduced in all countries.\n\nIMMOFINANZ AG can require compensation from the other business units for the minimum tax it pays in line with the regulations defined by company law but no compensatory agreements have been concluded to date.\n\nThe quantitative effects from the application of the Minimum Tax Reform Act are currently under evaluation. Due to the complexity of the analyses and the fact that the necessary reporting processes must still be developed, the effects cannot be reliably estimated at the present time.\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group applied the temporary exception from the accounting requirements for deferred taxes in IAS 12 which was announced by the IASB in May 2023. Accordingly, deferred taxes arising from the application of the Minimum Tax Reform Act were not recognised in 2023. No current taxes from the minimum taxation regulations were recognised as of 31 December 2023 in the absence of application.\n\n{196}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 4.10 Assets and liabilities held for sale\n\nIFRS 5 requires non-current assets and groups of assets (disposal groups) to be classified as held for sale if they can be sold in their present condition and if appropriate documentation shows a highly probable intention by management to sell the assets within 12 months. A documented intention by IMMOFINANZ Group's management to sell an asset is, as a rule, reflected in a resolution by the Executive Board and also by the Supervisory Board if the transaction requires the approval of this corporate body.\n\nNon-current assets and groups of assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The following items, among others, are excluded from the IFRS 5 valuation requirements: investment properties that are measured at fair value, financial assets and deferred tax assets. These non-current assets must be presented separately according to IFRS 5. A separate provision is generally recorded when an impairment loss must be recognised to a disposal group because expected selling costs must be deducted from fair value and these adjustments cannot be allocated to assets covered by the valuation rules in IFRS 5.\n\nThe intention to sell investment properties or groups of assets that include such properties can (e.g. in the event of a change-of-control clause) result in the premature repayment of financial liabilities. Any expected decisions concerning premature repayment represent changes in the estimates for cash flows from financial liabilities and lead to an adjustment of the carrying amount through profit or loss. Financial liabilities attributable to a disposal group are reported under \"liabilities held for sale\"; in all other cases, they are reclassified to current financial liabilities.\n\n| All amounts in TEUR         | Carrying<br>amount as of<br>31 12 2023 | Carrying<br>amount as of 31<br>12 2022 |\n|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Investment property         | 255,872                                | 510,406                                |\n| Other tangible assets       | 2,705                                  | 18                                     |\n| Trade and other receivables | 0                                      | 93                                     |\n| Other financial assets      | 0                                      | 6,021                                  |\n| Cash and cash equivalents   | 0                                      | 31,946                                 |\n| Assets held for sale        | 258,577                                | 548,484                                |\n| Financial liabilities       | 14,786                                 | 77,839                                 |\n| Trade and other payables    | 856                                    | 892                                    |\n| Provisions                  | 0                                      | 552                                    |\n| Deferred tax liabilities    | 10,293                                 | 47,963                                 |\n| Liabilities held for sale   | 25,935                                 | 127,246                                |\n\nDetails on the assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are provided below:\n\nOf the assets and liabilities classified as held for sale as of 31 December 2022, all commercial and residential properties (EUR 501.0 million) were sold by S IMMO in 2023. Plans to sell an office building in Romania, which was classified as held for sale as of 31 December 2022, had changed and the building was therefore reclassified to investment property.\n\nThe following properties were classified as assets held for sale in 2023: two Czech companies each with a hotel property; three retail properties and one office building in Austria; two retail, three residential and two office properties in Germany; and one office building and two land sites in Romania.\n\nAll sales, respectively divestment resolutions by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board are intended to align the portfolio with IMMOFINANZ Group's strategic focus.\n\n{197}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 4.11 Real estate inventories\n\nThe properties held for sale by IMMOFINANZ Group during the course of ordinary business operations do not fall under the scope of application of IAS 40, but are treated as inventories in accordance with IAS 2. As a rule, these inventories represent residential properties.\n\nInventories of residential properties are valued according to the moving average price method. Disposals are calculated on the basis of square meters and, after the recognition of additions, measured at the average price applicable to the respective quarter. A provision is recognised for any outstanding construction work required after the transfer of a property, which increases the production costs of the sold inventories as well as the book value disposals. The net selling prices used for valuation as of the balance sheet date are normally based on current list prices less outstanding project development costs and flat-rate marketing costs; to a lesser extent, they are measured at the appraised fair value as of the balance sheet date for simplification purposes. Estimation uncertainty in the determination of the net selling price, e.g. concerning the outstanding project development costs, could lead to negative margins on the sale of the inventories (in spite of previous loss-free measurement) if construction cost overruns occur at a later date.\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                            | 31 12 2023 | 31 12 2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Inventories carried at net realisable value less costs to sell | 4,485      | 4,663      |\n| Inventories carried at acquisition or production cost          | 356        | 300        |\n| Total                                                          | 4,841      | 4,963      |\n\nWrite-downs of EUR 0.2 million were recognised to real estate inventories in 2023 (2022: EUR 2.0 million).\n\n## 4.12 Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, funds in transit and deposits with financial institutions with a term up to three months and, to a lesser extent, with a longer term that includes a one-month cancellation option. These items are carried at the value applicable on the balance sheet date.\n\nThe balance sheet shows cash and cash equivalents of EUR 697.1 million as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 652.8 million). In addition, other financial receivables include various bank deposits whose use is restricted (restricted funds, see section 4.7). The assets held for sale included no cash and cash equivalents as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 31.9 million).\n\n## 4.13 Equity\n\nShare capital totalled EUR 138.7 million as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 138.7 million). It is divided into 138,669,711 (31 December 2022: 138,669,711) zero par value shares, each of which represents a stake of EUR 1.00 in share capital. All shares are fully paid in.\n\nThe number of shares developed as follows:\n\n| Number of shares                               | 2023        | 2022        |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Balance at the beginning of the financial year | 138,669,711 | 123,293,795 |\n| Issue of shares                                | 0           | 15,375,916  |\n| Balance at the end of the financial year       | 138,669,711 | 138,669,711 |\n\nThe Executive Board is not aware of any agreements between shareholders of IMMOFINANZ AG that restrict voting rights or the transfer of shares. All shares are bearer shares and entitle the holders to participate in the annual general meeting and to exercise their voting rights. Each bearer share is entitled to one vote.\n\n{198}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Convertible bond and conditional capital\n\nIMMOFINANZ was informed on 3 December 2021 through a voting rights announcement in accordance with § 130 of the Austrian Stock Exchange Act of 2018 that CPI Property Group (\"CPIPG\") held an investment, directly and indirectly, of approximately 21.4% in the share capital of IMMOFINANZ AG. This investment gave CPIPG a controlling interest in IMMOFINANZ AG as defined in § 22 in connection with § 27 of the Austrian Takeover Act. The conversion price was therefore temporarily adjusted to EUR 18.8987 in accordance with the issue terms (before the adjustment: EUR 20.6333) up to the control date on 19 January 2022.\n\nThe capital increase from conversions totalled EUR 280.8 million and was serviced with 15,375,916 new shares. Due to the substantially reduced volume – a nominal value of only EUR 3.2 million was outstanding after the conversions – IMMOFINANZ called the convertible bond for premature redemption on 29 April 2022 in accordance with the issue terms.\n\nThe annual general meeting on 3 May 2023 authorised the Executive Board, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, pursuant to § 174 (2) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act to issue convertible bonds up to a total nominal value of EUR 618,092,498.00 which are connected with exchange and/or subscription rights for up to 69,334,855 bearer shares of the company with a proportional share of EUR 69,334,855.00 in share capital. These convertible bonds may be issued in multiple tranches and within a period of five years. Moreover, the Executive Board was authorised to determine all other conditions as well as the issue and exchange procedures for the convertible bonds. The convertible bonds can be issued in exchange for cash or contributions in kind. The subscription rights of shareholders are excluded.\n\nShare capital was conditionally increased by up to EUR 69,334,855.00 through the issue of up to 69,334,855 new bearer shares. The purpose of this conditional capital increase is the issue of shares to the holders of the convertible bonds which were issued in accordance with a resolution of the annual general meeting on 3 May 2023.\n\nThe authorisation for the issue of convertible bonds has not been used to date and is therefore available in full.\n\n#### Share buyback programme 2022\n\nIMMOFINANZ purchased 694,557 shares at a weighted average price of EUR 14.58 per share from 20 June 2022 to 29 July 2022 through the share buyback programme 2022. The total purchase price amounted to EUR 10,126,484.94.\n\nThe share buyback programme 2022 was based on § 65 (1) no. 8 of the Austrian Stock Exchange Act and executed in accordance with an authorisation of the annual general meeting on 1 October 2020 (which was renewed by an authorisation of the annual general meeting on 12 July 2022). The repurchased shares represent EUR 694,557.00, or roughly 0.5% of share capital.\n\nIMMOFINANZ held 695,585 treasury shares as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 695,585 treasury shares).\n\n#### Authorisations of the annual general meeting to purchase and sell treasury shares\n\nThe annual general meeting on 3 May 2023 authorised the Executive Board, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to repurchase the company's shares in accordance with § 65 (1) no. 8 and (1a) and (1b) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act at an amount equalling up to 10% of share capital during a period of 30 months. The shares may be purchased over the stock exchange or over the counter. The Executive Board was also authorised, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the proportional subscription rights of shareholders.\n\nThe Executive Board was also authorised, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to sell or use treasury shares in another manner than over the stock exchange or through a public offering in accordance with § 65 (1b) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act during a period of five years, whereby the proportional subscription rights of shareholders can be excluded.\n\n{199}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe authorisation for the purchase and sale of treasury shares has not been used to date and is therefore available in full.\n\n#### Authorised capital\n\nThe annual general meeting on 3 May 2023 authorised the Executive Board, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, pursuant to § 169 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act to increase the company's share capital by up to EUR 69,334,855.00 through the issue of up to 69,334,855 new shares in exchange for cash or contributions in kind. The authorisation is valid up to 21 July 2028. The Executive Board is also authorised, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the subscription rights of shareholders in full or in part. The shares issued based on this authorisation in exchange for cash contributions and under the exclusion of shareholders' subscription rights may not exceed EUR 13,866,971.00, which represents roughly 10% of the company's share capital at the time the resolution was passed by the annual general meeting.\n\nThis authorisation to increase share capital has not been used to date and is therefore available in full.\n\n{200}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 4.14 Financial liabilities\n\nThe following table shows the composition and remaining terms of the financial liabilities as of 31 December 2023 and 2022:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                             | 31 12 2023 | thereof re<br>maining term<br>under 1 year | thereof re<br>maining term<br>between<br>1 and 5 years | thereof re<br>maining term<br>over 5 years | 31 12 2022 | thereof re<br>maining term<br>under 1 year | thereof re<br>maining term<br>between<br>1 and 5 years | thereof re<br>maining term<br>over 5 years |\n|-------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Amounts due to financial in<br>stitutions       | 3,296,541  | 235,076                                    | 2,025,244                                              | 1,036,221                                  | 2,766,246  | 301,312                                    | 1,724,963                                              | 739,971                                    |\n| thereof secured by colla<br>teral               | 3,296,354  | 234,889                                    | 2,025,244                                              | 1,036,221                                  | 2,766,128  | 301,194                                    | 1,724,963                                              | 739,971                                    |\n| thereof not secured by<br>collateral            | 187        | 187                                        | 0                                                      | 0                                          | 118        | 118                                        | 0                                                      | 0                                          |\n| Liabilities arising from the is<br>sue of bonds | 820,539    | 120,810                                    | 573,189                                                | 126,540                                    | 922,825    | 208,684                                    | 530,090                                                | 184,051                                    |\n| Other financial liabilities                     | 166,451    | 76,872                                     | 40,571                                                 | 49,008                                     | 478,399    | 9,841                                      | 84,281                                                 | 384,277                                    |\n| Total                                           | 4,283,531  | 432,758                                    | 2,639,004                                              | 1,211,769                                  | 4,167,470  | 519,837                                    | 2,339,334                                              | 1,308,299                                  |\n\nThe liabilities from the issue of bonds represent fixed-interest, unsecured, non-subordinated bonds. They include one bond issued by IMMOFINANZ AG with an outstanding nominal value of EUR 237.8 million (31 December 2022: two bonds, nominal value of EUR 424.9 million) and nine bonds issued by S IMMO AG with a total outstanding nominal value of EUR 620.6 million (31 December 2022: eight bonds, nominal value: EUR 545.6 million). In 2022, the decline in the balance of bonds issued by IMMOFINANZ AG resulted from the change-of-control event which was triggered by the majority takeover by CPI Property Group. This changeof-control event entitled the bondholders to exercise their sale right at 101% of the nominal value plus accrued interest up to the sale date on 25 April 2022.

Consequently, all rights and obligations from these loans are attributable to the respective real estate company. These property loans include standard market obligations (hard financial covenants) for compliance with specific financial indicators by the property company, which generally involve:\n\n– Debt service coverage ratios\n\n– The ratio of the remaining debt to the market value of the property (loan-to-value)\n\nThe financing banks are entitled to call the outstanding loan prematurely in individual cases if the borrower fails to comply with specific financial covenants or does not implement contractually defined, accepted measures to remedy the situation. One covenant was breached as of 31 December 2023, and the related credit liability of EUR 6.7 million was therefore reclassified from other non-current to other current financial liabilities. In addition, one company failed to meet a legally defined equity ratio in 2023 and the banks in Slovakia were entitled to prematurely call the related loans. An amount of EUR 90.3 million was therefore reclassified from non-current to current financial liabilities. There were no covenant breaches in 2022.\n\n{202}------------------------------------------------\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                        | 31 12 2023 | thereof re-<br>maining

value of the expected settlement amount. The provision is based on the best estimate at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. The best estimate of the amount required to meet the present obligation is the amount the company would rationally pay to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date or to transfer the obligation to a third party at that time. The risks and uncertainties that inevitably surround many events and circumstances must be taken into account in determining the best estimate. Valuation is therefore based in part on expert opinions and, above all, on past experience, probabilities for the outcome of legal disputes or proceedings under tax law, future cost trends, assumptions over interest rates, etc.\n\n{203}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe provisions developed as follows in 2023:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                    | 2023   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Balance at the beginning of the financial year         | 32,155 |\n| Disposals following the sale of subsidiaries (see 2.5) | -3,871 |\n| Foreign exchange differences                           | -1     |\n| Additions                                              | 24,125 |\n| Disposals                                              | -2,648 |\n| Use                                                    | -7,397 |\n| Compounding                                            | 269    |\n| Reclassifications                                      | -343   |\n| Balance at the end of the financial year               | 42,289 |\n| thereof current                                        | 11,245 |\n| thereof non-current                                    | 31,044 |\n\nThis position includes provisions of EUR 28.7 million (2022: EUR 19.0 million) for legal proceedings, EUR 6.2 million (2022: EUR 7.9 million) for work outstanding and warranties following the transfer of properties in the core market of Germany, and other provisions. The other provisions consist primarily of provisions for tax risks (above all, withholding, VAT and property tax), contractual obligations and obligations to employees (e.g. for bonuses and unused vacation).\n\nRestitution proceedings are currently in progress over land on which a Romanian subsidiary constructed a shopping center and over parts of another parcel of land in Romania. Based on a recent, not yet binding, court decision, the provision for this issue was increased by EUR 10.5 million to EUR 26.4 million.\n\nThe use of provisions in 2023 was related, above all, to completions and warranty claims. Detailed information on the provisions for legal proceedings is not provided in accordance with IAS 37 because it could, under certain circumstances, seriously prejudice IMMOFINANZ Group's position.\n\nProvisions include the following for employees of S IMMO: provisions of EUR 0.5 million (2022: EUR 0.7 million) for entitlements to termination payments and provisions of EUR 0.5 million (2022: EUR 0.4 million) for entitlements to service anniversary bonuses. The actuarial calculation of these obligations was based on a discount rate of 2.95% to 3.03% (2022: 3.07% to 3.10%), an expected increase of 2.6% (2022: 2.6%) in salaries and wages, and a flat-rate discount of 0% to 26.0% (2022: 0% to 26.0%) for employee turnover. The requirement to create a provision for termination benefits is based on the applicable regulations under labour law. Legal regulations require S IMMO to make a one-off payment to employees who joined the company in Austria prior to 1 January 2003 in the event of termination by the employer or at retirement. The amount of the payment is dependent on the number of service years and the compensation at the end of employment and ranges from two to twelve months' wages/salaries.\n\n{204}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-204-0\"></span>5. Notes to the Consolidated Income Statement\n\n## 5.1 Results of asset management\n\n#### 5.1.1 Rental income\n\nThe following table shows the classification of rental income by asset class:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                               | 2023    | 2022    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Office                                                            | 244,338 | 132,483 |\n| Retail                                                            | 241,518 | 156,139 |\n| Other                                                             | 28,115  | 257     |\n| thereof hotel                                                     | 7,366   | 0       |\n| thereof residential                                               | 19,915  | 0       |\n| thereof other                                                     | 834     | 257     |\n| Income from non-performance-related components of operating costs | 19,630  | 11,291  |\n| Total                                                             | 533,601 | 300,170 |\n\nThe year-on-year increase in rental income resulted primarily from the full consolidation of S IMMO and from the acquisition of retail properties. S IMMO contributed EUR 200.9 million to rental income in 2023, whereby EUR 123.4 million is attributable to the office asset class, EUR 41.9 million to retail, EUR 27.5 million to other and EUR 8.3 million to non-performance related components.\n\nAll leases in which IMMOFINANZ Group serves as the lessor are classified as operating leases, and all leased property is therefore carried on IMMOFINANZ Group's balance sheet. The resulting rental income is distributed on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The lease term includes the non-cancellable contract periods as well as option periods when the exercise of the extension option is sufficiently certain at the beginning of the lease. Incentives granted for the conclusion or extension of leases (e.g. rent-free periods, reduced rents for a certain period, graduated rents that increase at fixed rates over the lease term, fit-outs for individual tenants or the assumption of relocation costs) are included in the determination of the fair value of investment property and recognised as an adjustment to rental income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Contractually agreed, inflation-based rental price adjustments are recognised when the adjustments take effect and not on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Contingent rental income (generally turnoverbased rents) is only recognised when it is realised. The contingent rental income totalled EUR 18.2 million in 2023 (2022: EUR 17.8 million) and is included in the rental income from the retail asset class. Penalties for the premature cancellation of leases amounted to EUR 4.6 million (2022: EUR 1.5 million).\n\nWhen renegotiation, additions or amendments lead to a material change in the cash flows realisable over the remaining term of a rental agreement, the previous accruals from incentive agreements – with the exception of fit-outs that will be reused – are derecognised as a reduction of rental income. If there is no material change in the rental agreement, the previously accrued incentives remain unchanged and are recognised on a straightline basis. The general rules for the recognition of rental income on the initial conclusion of a rental agreement also apply when there is a substantial change in the rental agreement.\n\n{205}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe rental income from the contracts in effect as of 31 December is as follows:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR   | 2023      | 2022      |\n|-----------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Within 1 year         | 498,661   | 338,262   |\n| Between 1 and 5 years | 1,172,767 | 741,185   |\n| Over 5 years          | 485,047   | 301,986   |\n| Total                 | 2,156,475 | 1,381,433 |\n\nFuture rental income shown was adjusted to exclude the contracts related to disposal groups and discontinued operations as of the balance sheet date. Special cancellation rights or additional rental income from turnoverbased rents are not included. The reported income from existing leases in IMMOFINANZ Group includes future index-based adjustments, whereby an average term of 15 years was applied to open-end rental contracts.\n\nRental income includes the revenues which are not contrasted by the provision of services in the narrower sense of the term, but only represents the reimbursement of costs connected with legal ownership of the property (i.e. property tax and building insurance). The income from the non-performance-related components of operating costs has been presented since 2021 independent of the office, retail and other asset classes. The revenues from advertising space and telecommunications equipment are also reported as rental income in accordance with IFRS 16. The rental income from property taxes and building insurance totalled EUR 19.6 million in 2023 (2022: EUR 11.3 million), and the revenues from advertising space and telecommunications equipment amounted to EUR 3.5 million (2022: EUR 3.8 million).\n\n#### 5.1.2 Operating costs charged to tenants and operating expenses\n\nThe income from operating costs charged to tenants represents revenue in the sense of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) and is recognised over time. Operating costs are generally charged on a monthly basis and do not include any material financing components. The segment report provides information on the allocation of revenue from operating costs charged to tenants to the individual IMMOFINANZ regional core markets (see section 3.6).\n\nThe income from operating costs charged to tenants totalled EUR 190.6 million in 2023 (2022: EUR 118.6 million). In individual countries (e.g. Hungary, Slovakia and Poland), this income also includes contractually agreed flat-rate administrative costs or mark-ups to operating costs that are also collected from tenants. Section 5.1.1, last paragraph, includes information on the income from operating costs charged to tenants, which is reported under rental income in accordance with IFRS 16.\n\nOperating expenses include EUR -225.9 million (2022: EUR -126.6 million) of operating costs which are charged to tenants as well as expenses of EUR -7.5 million (2022: EUR -9.4 million) from vacancies.\n\n#### 5.1.3 Expenses from investment property\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                | 2023    | 2022    |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Commission expenses                                | -2,499  | -372    |\n| Maintenance                                        | -27,961 | -21,826 |\n| Operating costs charged to building owners         | -17,221 | -14,709 |\n| Property marketing                                 | -2,719  | -6,382  |\n| Personnel expenses from asset management (see 5.7) | -9,706  | -4,977  |\n| Other expenses from asset management               | -4,276  | -3,924  |\n| Fit-out costs                                      | -1,661  | -3,770  |\n| Write-off of receivables from asset management     | -6,279  | -2,406  |\n| Other expenses                                     | -3,074  | -1,751  |\n| Total                                              | -75,396 | -60,117 |\n\nMaintenance costs are attributable to extraordinarily urgent measures at several office properties as well as regular building maintenance.\n\nConcessions made retroactively to tenants are recognised as write-offs to receivables. The increase in receivables write-offs resulted from the difficult financial situation of tenants in the gastronomy business in Poland. \n\n{206}------------------------------------------------\n\nRental deferrals granted for future periods are accounted for similar to rental incentives and are recognised to rental income over the remaining term of the underlying contract.\n\nGovernment grants are deducted directly from the related expenses (net method) in accordance with IAS 20.29. IMMOFINANZ Group received government grants of EUR 1.0 million in 2023 (2022: EUR 0.0 million).\n\n## 5.2 Results of owner-operated hotels\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                  | 2023    | 2022 |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------|------|\n| Income from owner-operated hotels                    | 70,023  | 0    |\n| Expenses from owner-operated hotels                  | -52,745 | 0    |\n| Depreciation and impairment on owner-operated hotels | -15,266 | 0    |\n| Total                                                | 2,012   | 0    |\n\nThe owner-operated properties represent hotels held by S IMMO Group, which was acquired in 2022.\n\n{207}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 5.3 Results of property sales\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                                        | 2023     | 2022    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|\n| Office                                                                     | 49,062   | 62,056  |\n| Retail                                                                     | 570      | 5,301   |\n| Other                                                                      | 302,442  | 2,897   |\n| Proceeds from property sales                                               | 352,074  | 70,254  |\n| Less carrying amount of sold properties                                    | -352,074 | -70,254 |\n| Net gain/loss from property sales                                          | 0        | 0       |\n| Results from deconsolidation (see 2.5)                                     | -35,219  | 5,443   |\n| Sales commissions                                                          | -1,288   | -1,114  |\n| Personnel expenses from property sales (see 5.7)                           | -728     | -474    |\n| Legal, auditing and consulting fees from property sales                    | -1,006   | -561    |\n| Income and expenses related to written-off receivables from property sales | 7,000    | -12,945 |\n| VAT adjustments from the sale of properties                                | -682     | -176    |\n| Other expenses                                                             | -2,389   | -899    |\n| Expenses from property sales                                               | 907      | -16,169 |\n| Revaluation results from properties sold and held for sale (see 5.8)       | -4,015   | 15,349  |\n| Total                                                                      | -38,327  | 4,623   |\n\nResults from the sale of properties show the income from asset deals involving IAS 40 and IFRS 5 properties. This income represents the fair value of the property on the transaction date and is therefore generally contrasted by a book value disposal of the same amount. The differences between the carrying amounts on the last balance sheet date and the last quarter prior to the sale are recorded under the revaluation results from standing investments, respectively property under construction. In contrast, the differences between the carrying amounts in the last quarter and the sale proceeds are recorded under the revaluation of investment property sold and held for sale. Real estate trading is not part of IMMOFINANZ Group's ordinary business activities. Therefore, the results of property sales do not represent revenue in the sense of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) but are classified as revenues from the sale of IAS 40 and IFRS 5 properties. Of the revenues recognised from property sales in 2023 (EUR 352.1 million), partial payment was received in 2022. As of 31 December 2023, the outstanding purchase price receivables from property sales totalled EUR 12.1 million (see section 4.7). The outstanding purchase price receivables from property sales reported as of 31 December 2022 (EUR 6.1 million) were paid in 2023.\n\nExpenses from property sales include all personnel and operating expenses directly related to the sale process for a property or property company.\n\nIncome of EUR 7.0 million from receivables previously written off involves the purchase price receivable from the sale of the Russian portfolio in 2017, which was scheduled for settlement in the first half of 2022. Due to the war in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation together with the resulting effects – above all the payment restrictions imposed by Russia – management classified this receivable as uncollectible and wrote off the full amount of EUR 12.9 million in 2022. A payment of EUR 7.0 million was received in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nRevaluation results reflect the adjustment of fair value when a property is sold and the valuation of investment property held for sale at the respective selling price.\n\n{208}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 5.4 Results of property development\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                                                                              | 2023    | 2022    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Proceeds from the sale of real estate inventories                                                                | 0       | 580     |\n| Cost of real estate inventories sold                                                                             | 0       | -512    |\n| Write-down related reversals of real estate inventories                                                          | 0       | 50      |\n| Write-down of real estate inventories                                                                            | -180    | -2,012  |\n| Income and expenses related to written-off purchase price receivables from the sale of real es- tate inventories | 0       | -1,014  |\n| Operating costs charged to building owners of real estate inventories                                            | 0       | -49     |\n| Other expenses from real estate inventories                                                                      | -1,788  | -3,914  |\n| Expenses from real estate inventories                                                                            | -1,968  | -6,939  |\n| Expenses from property development                                                                               | -2,831  | -3,261  |\n| Revaluation results from properties under construction (see 5.8)                                                 | -20,792 | -10,552 |\n| Total                                                                                                            | -25,591 | -20,684 |\n\nThe sale of real estate inventories is reported under income from property development. In accordance with IFRS 15, revenue is recognised over time when the performance provided leads to an asset with no alternative use for IMMOFINANZ Group and IMMOFINANZ Group has an enforceable right to payment for the performance transferred to date. This is regularly the case with residential properties which are sold during the planning or construction stage. In cases where these requirements are met, a proportional share of profit is recognised according to the percentage of completion (which represents the extent of performance provided) if the carrying amount of the involved property exceeds the agreed net realisable value less transaction costs.\n\nRevenue from the sale of properties with an alternative use or without an enforceable right to payment is still recognised at a point in time (i.e. with the transfer of economic ownership). This point in time is generally the date on which the property is transferred because it marks the transfer of opportunities and risks as well as economic control.\n\nThe following table classifies the proceeds from the sale of real estate inventories in 2023 according to the timing of revenue recognition:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                   | 2023 | 2022 |\n|---------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Revenue recognised at a point in time | 0    | 580  |\n| Income from derecognised liabilities  | 0    | 580  |\n\nThe allocation of revenue from the sale of real estate inventories to IMMOFINANZ Group's regional core markets is shown in the segment report (see section 3.6).\n\nThe impairment losses of EUR 2.0 million recognised to real estate inventories in 2022 consisted chiefly of the write-down of cancelled residential property sales in Germany to the net realisable value less transaction costs. The results of property development also include charges of EUR 1.0 million (2022: EUR 1.9 million) for personnel expenses.\n\n{209}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 5.5 Other operating income\n\nOther operating income comprises the following items:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                  | 2023  | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------|--------|\n| Expenses charged on                  | 460   | 188    |\n| Insurance compensation               | 670   | 1,461  |\n| Income from derecognised liabilities | 3,792 | 946    |\n| Reimbursement for penalties          | 397   | 183    |\n| Miscellaneous                        | 2,534 | 7,599  |\n| Total                                | 7,853 | 10,377 |\n\nThe share of S IMMO in other operating income equalled EUR 3.3 million in 2023. Miscellaneous other operating income in 2022 included income of EUR 6.5 million from the reimbursement of costs connected with the premature termination of a digitalisation project by CPI Property Group.\n\n## 5.6 Other operating expenses\n\nOther operating expenses include the following items:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                 | 2023    | 2022    |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Administrative expenses             | -5,657  | -2,983  |\n| Legal, auditing and consulting fees | -13,924 | -19,360 |\n| Penalties                           | -917    | -155    |\n| Taxes and levies                    | -4,517  | -2,495  |\n| Advertising                         | -3,113  | -3,689  |\n| EDP and communications              | -4,370  | -2,771  |\n| Expert opinions                     | -1,022  | -614    |\n| Personnel expenses (see 5.7)        | -23,469 | -25,967 |\n| Other write-downs                   | -4,335  | -2,128  |\n| Miscellaneous                       | -18,043 | -5,916  |\n| Total                               | -79,367 | -66,078 |\n\nThe full consolidation of S IMMO was responsible for EUR 35.3 million of other operating expenses in 2023.\n\nThe increase in administrative expenses resulted from the outsourcing of various activities to the service companies of the CPI Property Group and the related administrative charges. Directly attributable costs are reported under the respective functional operating area. If direct allocation is not possible, the administrative expenses are included under other operating expenses. Of the miscellaneous operating expenses, EUR 5.9 million (2022: EUR 3.0 million) represent administrative fees paid to CPI Property Group.\n\nThe decline in legal, auditing and consulting fees is attributable, above all, to the absence of costs recognised in 2022 for a Groupwide digitalisation project and to costs connected with the takeover offers by CPI Property Group and S IMMO.\n\nMiscellaneous other operating expenses include EUR 10.5 million arising from a court decision which is not yet legally binding and is related to restitution proceedings for land on which a Romanian subsidiary constructed a shopping center (also see section 4.16).\n\nOther write-downs include write-downs of EUR 0.5 million (2022: EUR 0.6 million) to right-of-use assets for other tangible assets (IFRS 16).\n\nThe costs for short-term leases and low-value leases equalled EUR 0.2 million in 2023 (2022: EUR 0.2 million). Other main components of miscellaneous other operating expenses were the costs connected with owner\n\n{210}------------------------------------------------\n\noperated properties, impairment losses and write-downs to other receivables, Supervisory Board remuneration and the costs for the annual general meeting as well as insurance premiums and costs for bank transactions.\n\nMiscellaneous other operating expenses also include TEUR 12.6 for research on office solutions in cooperation with Stanford University.

In cases where direct allocation is not possible, the personnel expenses are included under other operating expenses.\n\nThe average number of employees in the companies included in the consolidated financial statements totalled 250 in 2023 (2022: 301 employees). This statistic does not include employees on official leave (maternity, parental, military). The prior year data do not include any personnel expenses for S IMMO because that company was only fully consolidated as of 31 December 2022; the number of employees for 2022 does not include any S IMMO employees.\n\nS IMMO had a total workforce of 100 in 2023 (2022: 136 persons) excluding the employees in hotel operations, and 611 employees (2022: 583 persons) including the employees in hotel operations.\n\n{211}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 5.8 Revaluation results from investment property and goodwill\n\nThe results from the revaluation of investment properties and goodwill included valuation results of EUR - 352.0 million in 2023 (2022: EUR -110.5 million) and impairment losses to goodwill of EUR -0.2 million (2022: EUR -0.3 million). In 2022, this position also included a negative difference of EUR 214.6 million from the purchase of shares in S IMMO AG (see section 2.3).\n\nThe revaluation results from the standing investments include the revaluation of rights-of-use assets in accordance with IFRS 16 (EUR 0.2 million; 2022: EUR -1.4 million).\n\nThe following table shows the revaluation gains and losses on investment property:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR               | Revaluation gains | Revaluation losses | Total    | Revaluation gains | Revaluation losses | Total    |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|----------|-------------------|--------------------|----------|\n|                                   | 2023              |                    |          | 2022              |                    |          |\n| Investment property               | 235,727           | -587,761           | -352,034 | 91,218            | -201,717           | -110,499 |\n| Property under construction       | 1,380             | -22,172            | -20,793  | 6,125             | -16,677            | -10,552  |\n| Properties sold and held for sale | 170               | -4,185             | -4,015   | 15,762            | -413               | 15,349   |\n| Total                             | 237,277           | -614,118           | -376,841 | 113,105           | -218,807           | -105,702 |\n\nThe revaluation gains on investment property included EUR 117.7 million of purchase price adjustments that were deducted from the acquisition cost of real estate holding companies (see section 2.3). The remainder is primarily attributable to the revaluation of properties in the retail asset class.\n\nDetails on property under construction are provided in section 5.4, and details on property sold and held for sale can be found in section 5.3.\n\n## 5.9 Share of profit or loss from equity-accounted investments\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                    | Joint ventures | Associates | Total<br>2023 |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------|------------|---------------|\n| Share of profit or loss for the period | -189           | 6,053      | 5,864         |\n| Other adjustments                      | 0              | -5,526     | -5,526        |\n| Total                                  | -189           | 527        | 338           |\n\nOther adjustments include an impairment loss of EUR -5.5 million.\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                                        | Joint ventures | Associates | Total<br>2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|------------|---------------|\n| Share of profit or loss for the period                                     | 0              | 26,899     | 26,899        |\n| Other adjustments                                                          | 0              | -191,653   | -191,653      |\n| Reclassification of foreign exchange differences reserve to profit or loss | 0              | 1,925      | 1,925         |\n| Gains/losses on the sale of equity-accounted investments                   | 0              | 10,947     | 10,947        |\n| Total                                                                      | 0              | -151,882   | -151,882      |\n\nIn 2022, the share of profit or loss from equity-accounted investments included proportional results of EUR 19.8 million for the period from S IMMO, the carryforward of EUR 0.6 million in fair value adjustments identified in connection with the acquisition of the shares during the purchase price allocation as well as an impairment loss of EUR -192.2 million to the S IMMO investment from the transition consolidation. The transition consolidation involved the reclassification to profit or loss of EUR 12.9 million in differences from foreign currency translation and the change in the hedge accounting reserve. The total effect from S IMMO amounted to EUR 55.6 million and comprised EUR -159.0 million of results from the at-equity valuation of the investment and a negative difference of EUR 214.6 million (see section 2.3).\n\nAggregated financial information on the joint ventures and associates is presented in section 4.6.\n\n{212}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 5.10 Financial results\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                                                                     | 2023     | 2022     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| For financial liabilities AC                                                                            | -178,152 | -70,334  |\n| For derivative financial instruments                                                                    | -31,868  | -7,430   |\n| Total financing costs                                                                                   | -210,020 | -77,764  |\n| For financial receivables AC                                                                            | 12,036   | 1,669    |\n| For financial receivables FVPL                                                                          | 30       | 0        |\n| For derivative financial instruments                                                                    | 79,921   | 3,891    |\n| Total financing income                                                                                  | 91,987   | 5,560    |\n| Foreign exchange differences                                                                            | -8,845   | 2,333    |\n| Profit or loss on other financial instruments and proceeds on the disposal of financial instru<br>ments | -1,901   | -6,331   |\n| Valuation of financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss                                 | -118,980 | 156,263  |\n| Distributions                                                                                           | 1,316    | 798      |\n| Valuation adjustments and impairment of receivables                                                     | 76       | -64      |\n| Negative interest on cash and cash equivalents                                                          | -30      | -1,530   |\n| Other financial results                                                                                 | -119,519 | 149,136  |\n| Net profit or loss from equity-accounted investments (see 5.9)                                          | 338      | -151,882 |\n| Total                                                                                                   | -246,059 | -72,617  |\n\nAC: Financial assets/liabilities measured at amortised cost)\n\nThe financing costs for financial liabilities measured at amortised cost include interest expense of EUR -2.3 million (2022: EUR -1.9 million) for IFRS 16 lease liabilities.

IMMOFINANZ AG serves as the lead company of this group. The lead company and the members of the tax group concluded an agreement for the settlement of taxes, which was amended in 2011/12. Each member with positive results must pay a tax charge to the lead company. The charge equals 24% of the assessment base and is based on the tax rate defined in § 22 (1) of the Austrian Corporate Tax Act. Any losses by the group members are registered and can be offset in full against taxable profit recorded by the respective member in subsequent years. Group members with registered tax losses are not required to make payments to the lead company; no payments for (negative) charges are made by the lead company to the group members.\n\nAnother corporate tax group was established in 2009/10 pursuant to § 9 of the Austrian Corporate Tax Act. CPB Enterprise GmbH serves as the lead company of this group. Based on the group and tax assessment agreement concluded on 22 December 2009, the taxable income generated by the members of this group is allocated to CPB Enterprise GmbH, as the lead company of the group, after an offset against any pre-group losses. The group contract also calls for a tax charge as settlement for the transfer of taxable income. The tax \n\n{214}------------------------------------------------\n\ncharge procedure for this tax group is the same as the new tax charge agreement implemented for the IMMOFINANZ AG corporate group; it took effect starting in the 2011/12 financial year.\n\nS IMMO Group also had a corporate tax group pursuant to § 9 of the Austrian Corporate Tax Act with S IMMO AG as the lead company of this group. This tax group was integrated in the IMMOFINANZ tax group during 2023. Based on the tax assessment agreement concluded between the IMMOFINANZ AG and S IMMO companies, S IMMO AG with its subsidiaries forms a separate accounting entity for the tax charge. If S IMMO AG generates positive results, it is required to pay a (positive) tax charge to the head of the group equal to 20% of the assessment base. The generation of positive results by the S IMMO group members results in the payment of a (positive) tax charge to S IMMO AG equal to 24% of the assessment base. Losses incurred by the tax subgroup, respectively by the S IMMO group members are registered and can be offset in full against taxable profit recorded by the respective tax subgroup or S IMMO group member in subsequent years. Payments by S IMMO AG to the lead company or by an S IMMO group member to S IMMO AG are not required when registered losses are utilised. No payments for (negative) charges are made by the lead company to S IMMO AG or by S IMMO AG to the S IMMO group members.\n\n## 5.12 Earnings per share\n\nIn accordance with IAS 33, earnings per share are calculated by dividing net profit for the period attributable to the shareholders of IMMOFINANZ AG by the weighted average number of shares outstanding.\n\n|                                                                     | 2023         | 2022        |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Weighted average number of shares (basic)                           | 137,974,126  | 136,866,509 |\n| Weighted average number of shares (diluted)                         | 137,974,126  | 136,866,509 |\n| Net profit or loss (excl. non-controlling interests) in EUR         | -180,316,000 | 142,601,000 |\n| Net profit or loss excl. non-controlling interests in EUR (diluted) | -180,316,000 | 142,601,000 |\n| Basic earnings per share in EUR                                     | -1.31        | 1.04        |\n| Diluted earnings per share in EUR                                   | -1.31        | 1.04        |\n\nThere were no diluting effects in 2023 or in the previous year. The calculation of the number of shares as of 31 December 2023 included the 695,585 treasury shares held by IMMOFINANZ (31 December 2022: 695,585 shares).\n\n{215}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-215-0\"></span>6. Notes to the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement\n\nThe cash flow statement of IMMOFINANZ Group shows the changes in cash and cash equivalents resulting from the inflow and outflow of funds during the financial year. The cash flow statement distinguishes between cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Interest paid is reported under cash flow from financing activities, while interest and dividends received are reported under cash flow from investing activities. Cash flow from operating activities is calculated using the indirect method. Cash and cash equivalents comprise the following as of the balance sheet dates shown below:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                          | 31 12 2023 | 31 12 2022 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents (see 4.12)                         | 697,119    | 652,750    |\n| Cash and cash equivalents held by disposal groups (see 4.10) | 0          | 31,946     |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                    | 697,119    | 684,696    |\n\nForeign currency cash flows are translated at the weighted average exchange rate for the respective local currency and quarter. Translation differences arising from the use of this exchange rate and the mean exchange rate on the balance sheet date are charged or credited to foreign exchange differences.\n\nThe position \"business combinations and other acquisitions, net of cash and cash equivalents\" totalling EUR -1,023.9 million resulted almost entirely from transactions with CPI Property Group. Information on these transactions is provided in section 2.3.\n\n{216}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following table reconciles financial liabilities, derivatives and equity,

Other Disclosures\n\n## 7.1 Information on financial instruments\n\nThe primary financial instruments held by IMMOFINANZ Group which are reported under assets consist primarily of trade accounts receivable, financing receivables, loans and other receivables, real estate fund shares, miscellaneous other financial instruments and cash and cash equivalents. The primary financial instruments recorded under liabilities consist primarily of financial liabilities, liabilities arising from convertible bonds and trade accounts payable. The non-derivative financial instruments recorded under assets are carried at fair value through profit or loss (shares in other companies), at fair value through other comprehensive income (shares in other companies) or at amortised cost. Non-derivative financial liabilities are carried at amortised cost. Fair value is based on market prices or calculated in accordance with recognised valuation methods.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used to hedge the interest rate risk arising from business operations (see section 7.2.5).\n\n#### 7.1.1 Classes and categories of financial instruments\n\nIFRS 7 requires the breakdown of financial instruments by classes as well as the reconciliation of these classes with the line items shown on the balance sheet. Since the reporting company is entitled to define these classes, they generally differ from the categories defined by IFRS 9 for the measurement of financial instruments.\n\nThe definition of the reportable classes reflects the different characteristics of the major financial instruments held by IMMOFINANZ Group. Accordingly, similar financial instruments are grouped together into a class. The classes are also defined to facilitate reconciliation with the line items shown on the balance sheet. These factors led to the definition of the following classes: trade accounts receivable, financing receivables, loans and other receivables (including restricted funds), derivatives, miscellaneous other financial instruments and cash and cash equivalents (asset classes) as well as liabilities arising from bonds, liabilities with financial institutions, other financial liabilities, trade accounts payable, derivatives and miscellaneous other liabilities (liability classes).\n\nIn addition to the assignment of financial instruments to classes, IFRS 7 requires the disclosure of the carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities in accordance with the categories defined in IFRS 9. The following table presents the carrying amount and fair value of each class of financial assets and financial liabilities as well as each IFRS 9 category and reconciles these amounts to the appropriate balance sheet line items. Since the balance sheet positions \"trade and other receivables\" and \"trade and other liabilities\" can contain financial instruments as well as non-financial assets/liabilities (e.g. tax receivables), the column \"Non-FI\" allows for a full reconciliation with the balance sheet line.\n\n{219}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Assets

profit or loss\n\nAC: financial assets/liabilities measured at amortised cost Non-FI: non-financial assets/liabilities\n\nThe fair values shown in the above table were derived from stock exchange prices or determined by applying recognised valuation methods, depending on the class (see section 7.1.3).\n\nTrade account receivables are generally considered to be current or are carried net of any necessary valuation adjustments and, for this reason, fair value generally reflects the carrying amount. The same applies to cash and cash equivalents.\n\nThe fair value of financial receivables, loans and other receivables as well as the fair value of the miscellaneous other financial instruments also generally approximates the carrying amount because impairment losses have already been deducted.\n\nThe fair values shown in the above table for amounts due to financial institutions were calculated as the present value of future interest and principal payments. The discount rate includes a margin for IMMOFINANZ's own credit risk, and the valuation method used to determine fair value therefore represents Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 13. Information on the method used to determine the debt value adjustment is provided in section 7.1.3. The discount rates used to calculate the present value of the amounts due to financial institutions were based on the listing shown below, which reflects the market interest rates as of 31 December 2023 and the average credit spreads for the loans held as of the balance sheet date.\n\n|                      |        | 2023   |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Discount rates as of | min    | max    |\n| 1 1 2024             | 3.542% | 5.042% |\n| 1 1 2025             | 3.134% | 4.634% |\n| 1 1 2026             | 3.714% | 5.214% |\n| 1 1 2027             | 3.629% | 5.129% |\n| 1 1 2028             | 3.606% | 5.106% |\n| 1 1 2029             | 3.611% | 5.111% |\n| 1 1 2030             | 3.625% | 5.125% |\n| 1 1 2031             | 3.651% | 5.151% |\n| 1 1 2032             | 3.679% | 5.179% |\n| 1 1 2033             | 3.713% | 5.213% |\n\nThe fair value of the bonds is based on the market price or, for inactive markets, the present value of future interest payments. The fair value of the miscellaneous other liabilities corresponds to the present value (financial liabilities) or to the carrying amount (all other cases).\n\n{221}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 7.1.2 Net gains and losses\n\nThe net gains and losses which must be presented in accordance with IFRS 7 for each category of financial instrument defined in IFRS 9 comprise the following:\n\n|                                                                       |                              |                                         |                       | 31 12 2023    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|\n| All amounts in TEUR                                                   | Measurement<br>at fair value | Income from<br>disposals/<br>repurchase | Other<br>gains/losses | Net gain/loss |\n| FVOCI                                                                 | 1,187                        | 0                                       | 535                   | 1,722         |\n| thereof recognised to the consolidated income state-<br>ment          | 0                            | 0                                       | 535                   | 535           |\n| thereof designated and recorded under other compre-<br>hensive income | 1,187                        | 0                                       | 0                     | 1,187         |\n| FA-FVPL                                                               | -119,029                     | 0                                       | 484                   | -118,545      |\n| thereof mandatory                                                     | -119,029                     | 0                                       | 484                   | -118,545      |\n| FL-FVPL                                                               | 49                           | 0                                       | 0                     | 49            |\n| thereof mandatory                                                     | 49                           | 0                                       | 0                     | 49            |\n| FL-AC                                                                 | 0                            | 0                                       | -1,604                | -1,604        |\n\nFVOCI: financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income FA-FVPL/FL-FVPL: financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss FA-AC/FL-AC: financial assets/liabilities measured at amortised cost\n\nFA-AC/FL-AC: financial assets/liabilities measured at amortised cost\n\n#### 31 12 2022\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                               | Measurement<br>at fair value | Income from<br>disposals/<br>repurchase | Other<br>gains/losses | Net gain/loss |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------|\n| FVOCI                                             | -2,537                       | 0                                       | 0                     | -2,537        |\n| thereof recorded under other comprehensive income | -2,537                       | 0                                       | 0                     | -2,537        |\n| FA-FVPL                                           | 156,263                      | 0                                       | 797                   | 157,060       |\n| thereof mandatory                                 | 156,263                      | 0                                       | 797                   | 157,060       |\n| FL-AC                                             | 0                            | -5,580                                  | -750                  | -6,330        |\n\nInformation on interest expense and interest income is provided in section 5.10.\n\n#### 7.1.3 Hierarchy of financial instruments carried at fair value\n\nThe following section includes an analysis of the financial instruments carried at fair value.

The interest rates used to discount the future cash flows are based on an interest curve that is observable on the market. The following three parameters are required to calculate the credit value adjustment (CVA) and the debt value adjustment (DVA): the probability of default (PD), the loss given default (LGD) and the exposure at default (EAD). The probability of default is derived from the credit default swap (CDS) spreads of the respective counterparty. Derivatives with a positive fair value represent receivables for IMMOFINANZ Group; in these cases, a CVA calculation is used to calculate the amount of the receivable. One parameter for this calculation is the probability of default for the counterparty. IMMOFINANZ Group contracts with over 15 financial institutions, and observable CDS spreads are available on the market for many of them. In exceptional cases, average branch benchmarks are used as a substitute for unavailable spreads. These benchmarks represent Level 1 and 2 input factors on the fair value measurement hierarchy. Derivatives with a negative fair value represent liabilities for IMMOFINANZ Group; in these cases, a DVA calculation is used to calculate the amount of the liability and the own probability of default must be determined. IMMOFINANZ Group generally concludes derivatives at the level of the property company that manages a particular property. Neither observable market CDS spreads, nor benchmarks are available for these property companies. Credit margins are therefore used to estimate CDS spreads which, in turn, form the basis for deriving the probability of default. The determination of the credit margins includes information from signed credit agreements and term sheets as well as indicative credit margin offers from banks based on the respective countries and asset classes. The plausibility of the calculated credit margins is also verified by comparison with external market reports. This procedure results in market-conform credit margins that can be used as estimates for valuing the company's own credit risk. These input factors represent Level 3 on the IFRS 13 measurement hierarchy. The loss given default (LGD) is the relative value that would be lost on default. IMMOFINANZ Group uses an ordinary market default rate to calculate the CVA and DVA. The exposure at default represents the expected \n\n{223}------------------------------------------------\n\namount of the asset or liability at the time of default. The calculation of the exposure at the time of default is based on a Monte Carlo simulation.\n\nFor net present value methods, an increase in the discount rate, exit yield or counterparty CDS values leads to a reduction in fair value. In contrast, fair value is increased by a reduction of these input factors.\n\nThe valuation of default risk includes assumptions for the probability of default, loss rate and the outstanding amount at the time of expected default. An increase in the probability of default and the loss rate will reduce the fair value of a derivative with a positive outstanding amount (receivable) and reduce the liability for a derivative with a negative outstanding amount (liability). A decrease in the probability of default and the loss rate leads to the opposite effect.\n\n{224}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 7.1.4 Collateral\n\nThe collateral for loans related to project financing is normally provided by the respective group company. Financing is generally concluded at the individual project level. As security for the loan, the lending bank receives a package of collateral that can be used to satisfy its receivables in the event a loan is called. This security package can include the following types of collateral:\n\n- Mortgage on the land or the land and the building\n- Pledge of shares in the project company\n- Pledge of receivables (from rental agreements, insurance contracts, property management contracts etc.)\n- Pledge of bank accounts (accounts for rental payments or other project-related accounts)\n- Promissory notes\n- Shares in subsidiaries\n\nThe conditions, type and scope of collateral are defined on an individual basis (for each company and property) and are dependent on the project volume and the amount and term of the loan.\n\nInvestment property with a carrying amount of EUR 6,562.8 million (31 December 2022: EUR 6,257.2 million) was pledged as collateral for debt financing of EUR 3,420.4 million (31 December 2022: EUR 2,899.3 million).\n\nNo property under construction was pledged as collateral as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: collateral with a total carrying amount of EUR 72.3 million for debt financing of EUR 30.1 million).\n\nFor property financing concluded by IMMOFINANZ Group, shares in the respective subsidiary serve as additional collateral in 77 cases (31 December 2022: 50 cases). The limitations on disposal end when the financial liability is repaid or when other collateral is provided.\n\nIn 2023 and in previous years, IMMOFINANZ Group accepted liabilities or guarantees on behalf of third parties with a maximum risk of EUR 15.6 million (31 December 2022: EUR 12.6 million). The probability of occurrence for these contingent liabilities is linked to the fulfilment or non-fulfilment of future conditions and was considered low as of the balance sheet date.\n\n## 7.2 Financial risk management\n\n#### 7.2.1 General information\n\nIMMOFINANZ has integrated an active risk management system into its operating processes and reporting paths. This system supports the rapid implementation of measures to counter risk and also has a direct influence on strategic decisions and operating processes. Internal guidelines, reporting systems and control measures have been installed throughout the corporation to support the monitoring, evaluation and control of risks related to the operating business. Risk management is a staff function which reports directly to the Executive Board. It autonomously monitors the corporate risks, aggregates risk data and reports, and actively supports the department and country organisations in the identification of risks and the implementation of economically suitable countermeasures. At the department and country organisation levels, the department head or country manager are responsible for risk management. The department heads and country managers report their risk positions to the Executive Board at least once each quarter, whereby acute risks are communicated immediately. IMMOFINANZ also works to continuously improve the internal control system (ICS) to support the early identification and monitoring of risks. A description of the ICS is provided in the management report.\n\n{225}------------------------------------------------\n\nAs an international corporation, IMMOFINANZ Group is exposed to various financial risks. The major financial risks for the Group arise from possible changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates and from the deterioration of the credit standing and solvency of its customers and business partners.\n\n#### 7.2.2 Default/credit risk\n\nDefault or credit risks arise from the possibility that the counterparty to a transaction could fail to meet the related obligations and IMMOFINANZ Group incurs financial damages as a result. The maximum credit risk represents the carrying amounts reported under assets on the balance sheet. Default risk is reflected in appropriate valuation adjustments.\n\nThe most important instrument for managing default risk is the continuous evaluation of the credit standing of contract partners. In various development projects, IMMOFINANZ Group works together with local project developers. This cooperation can represent a risk for IMMOFINANZ Group if the business partners are unable to meet their contractual obligations in full or on time. Appropriate contractual provisions – e.g. penalties or damage payments in cases where performance does not meet the contract terms – are used to address this risk. In addition, activities and goal attainment are monitored regularly by IMMOFINANZ Group's development department.\n\nThe risk of default on receivables due from tenants is generally low because tenants are regularly required to provide security deposits – cash deposits for residential properties, bank guarantees or cash deposits for commercial properties – and their credit standing is monitored on a regular basis. Individual valuation adjustments are generally recorded to receivables that are exposed to an increased risk of default.\n\nThe default risk associated with receivables due from banks is also considered to be low because all financing transactions are concluded with financial institutions that have excellent credit ratings. Counterparty and concentration risks are limited by continuous monitoring, fixed investment limits and the diversification of financial institutions. Banks are aggregated into a banking group and evaluated according to a common default probability. Receivables are combined and reviewed against appropriate limits.\n\nA default event is assumed to occur when the debtor is not expected to meet his or her credit obligations in full. A receivable is written off (derecognised) when it is overdue more than 365 days and collection measures have ceased or when the receivable is considered uncollectible in full even if it is not overdue more than one year.\n\nFinancial receivables are assigned to the following classes of financial instruments in IMMOFINANZ Group:\n\n- Trade accounts receivable\n- Financing receivables\n\n– Loans and other receivables\n\nThe next two tables present the following information in summarised form: the gross amount for each category of receivables as of the balance sheet date, the recognised impairment losses and resulting net receivables, a reconciliation of the beginning balance to the ending balance of the valuation allowances, and explanatory comments on the creation of the valuation allowances for each of the three receivables classes.\n\n{226}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                             | 2023                |            |                | 2022                |            |                |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------|------------|----------------|---------------------|------------|----------------|\n| All amounts in TEUR         | Gross<br>receivable | Impairment | Net receivable | Gross<br>receivable | Impairment | Net receivable |\n| Trade accounts receivable   | 99,990              | -19,098    | 80,892         | 88,075              | -14,851    | 73,224         |\n| Financing receivables       | 7,767               | -3,835     | 3,932          | 8,241               | -3,835     | 4,406          |\n| Loans and other receivables | 141,901             | -6,855     | 135,046        | 123,404             | -13,625    | 109,779        |\n| Total                       | 249,658             | -29,788    | 219,870        | 219,720             | -32,311    | 187,409        |\n\n#### Valuation allowances for trade accounts receivable\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                 | 2023    | 2022    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Beginning balance                                   | -14,851 | -13,248 |\n| Currency translation adjustments                    | -686    | 52      |\n| Additions following the acquisition of subsidiaries | -205    | -3,669  |\n| Write-offs                                          | 2,362   | 5,776   |\n| Revaluation                                         | -6,284  | -3,753  |\n| Reclassifications and other developments            | 566     | -9      |\n| Ending balance                                      | -19,098 | -14,851 |\n\nThe trade accounts receivable held by IMMOFINANZ Group comprise rents receivable, operating costs receivable and receivables from the sale of real estate inventories. The calculation of impairment for all these receivables is based on the simplified approach defined by IFRS 9.5.5.15, which requires the recognition of a loss allowance equal to the lifetime expected credit losses as of the initial recognition date as well as in subsequent periods. The application of the simplified approach to rents receivable, which represent lease receivables, is based on the option provided by this standard. The remaining trade receivables fall within the scope of application of IFRS 15 and do not include any material financing components. The application of the simplified approach is therefore mandatory.\n\nImpairment losses are based on historical experience in accordance with the number of days overdue. However, the calculation also includes more specific information on expected return flows or forward-looking assumptions if this information is available and if it is assumed that these factors will influence the amount of the impairment loss. Impairment losses were not recognised to the outstanding receivables of EUR 0.3 million (31 December 2022: EUR 0.9 million) from the sale of real estate inventories, which are reported as part of trade receivables, because the available collateral is considered sufficient.\n\nThe following table shows the gross receivables and impairment losses recognised for rents and operating costs receivable based on the time overdue as of 31 December 2023 as well as the average impairment in relation (%) to the average time overdue as of 31 December 2018, 2019, 2021 and 2022 (2020 was not included in the comparative data due to distortions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic):\n\n| All amounts in TEUR           | Gross receivable | Impairment | Impairment in % | Average impairment in<br>prior years |\n|-------------------------------|------------------|------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Not due until 90 days overdue | 79,459           | -3,553     | 4.47%           | 3.50%                                |\n| 91- 365 days overdue          | 7,798            | -4,049     | 51.93%          | 57.72%                               |\n| More than 365 days overdue    | 12,734           | -11,499    | 90.31%          | 97.12%                               |\n| Ending balance                | 99,990           | -19,102    |                 |                                      |\n\n{227}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Valuation allowances for financing receivables\n\n| All amounts in TEUR | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|\n| Beginning balance   | -3,835 | -3,835 |\n| Ending balance      | -3,835 | -3,835 |\n\nFinancing receivables consist primarily of financing for property companies which is collateralised by the property and the related return flows. Consequently, impairment losses were generally not required for these items.

These deposits with financial institutions have only a minimal risk of default, and it can therefore be assumed that the default risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition. The credit loss expected within the next 12 months was therefore determined in accordance with IFRS 9. For the remaining other receivables, an impairment loss was not required due to available collateral or an impairment loss was recognised because of an assumed default event at the amount of the expected loss over the lifetime of the financial instrument.\n\n#### 7.2.3 Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risks are minimised by careful planning with regular variance analyses. Daily liquidity management ensures that all operating obligations can be met and funds can be optimally invested, and also gives the Group the necessary flexibility to realise short-term acquisition opportunities.\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group also uses long-term financing in which the financial capability of the individual properties (interest coverage ratio, debt service coverage ratio) and present value (loan-to-value ratio) are reflected in appropriate contract clauses.\n\nIn order to prevent cost overruns and the resulting excess outflow of liquidity, IMMOFINANZ Group routinely monitors budgets and the progress of construction on all development projects and maintenance work.\n\nThe following table shows the term structure of derivative and non-derivative financial liabilities based on the contractually defined outflow of funds. In particular, the reported amounts include current and bullet repayments for financial liabilities, interest payments and net payments from derivatives. There were no derivative financial liabilities on record as of 31 December 2022 due to the strong positive development of the respective market values during the 2022 financial year.\n\n{228}------------------------------------------------\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                | Cash outflows<br>(-) / Cash in-<br>flows (+) under<br>1 year | Cash

Property Group, lease liabilities, trade accounts payable and liabilities from deposits received.\n\nThe amounts due to financial institutions by IMMOFINANZ Group are broadly diversified by region and counterparty, and the exposure to a change in the risk policy of an individual financial institution is therefore considered low.\n\nOn 9 June 2021, Czech Property Investments, a.s, (CPI CZ), CPI FIM S.A. (CPI FIM) – both wholly owned subsidiaries of CPI Property Group S.A. (CPIPG) – and UniCredit Bank Czech Republic and Slovakia a.s. (UniCredit) concluded a credit agreement over EUR 213,235,000.\n\nThis financing is related to properties acquired by CPI Property Group S.A. through share deals in the fourth quarter of 2023. In connection with the purchase transaction, SC Czech AHG, s.r.o. (S IMMO CZ) - a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of S IMMO AG – stated its intention to serve as joint debtor, effective as of 23 November 2023, and furthermore, to accept the terms of the facility agreement as a borrower and to be jointly and severally liable together with CPI CZ and CPI FIM.\n\nConsequently, S IMMO CZ is primarily responsible for the repayment of the loan, the payment of interest on the loan and all other payment obligations arising from the facility agreement. The existing loan liability is, therefore, recorded in full in the consolidated financial statements of IMMOFINANZ Group; there is no liability for the loans payable recognised by CPI CZ or CPI FIM S.A. Based on the joint and several liability for this loan and the cross-default clauses in the loan agreement, S IMMO CZ is exposed to the risk of possible default/possible insolvency by CPI CZ or CPI FIM because the financing bank would be entitled to call the loan in this case. However, this risk is considered low because S IMMO CZ has all rights to remedy a possible default by CPI CZ/CPI FIM (the cross-default clause in the loan agreement is limited to CPI CZ and CPI FIM). Any damages incurred by S IMMO CZ from a possible default in this connection are secured by a guarantee at first request which was provided by the parent company CPIPG.\n\n#### 7.2.4 Foreign exchange risk\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group is exposed to various forms of foreign exchange risk in connection with its accounting data and cash flows. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can influence the Group's earnings position and also have an impact on the Group's asset position.\n\n{229}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Effect on the asset and earnings position\n\nThe individual Group companies record transactions in a currency that differs from their functional currency at the mean exchange rate on the date of the respective transaction. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the mean exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. The resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss for the financial year.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, all liabilities to financial institutions were denominated in euros.\n\nThe risk of devaluation associated with foreign currency bank deposits and cash balances is offset by the earliest possible conversion of these funds into the euro.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used in some cases to manage the low structural foreign exchange risk. The derivative financial instruments used by IMMOFINANZ Group to hedge this risk are recorded as standalone derivatives and not as hedging instruments. Hedge accounting as defined in IFRS 9 is not applied and, therefore, the stand-alone derivatives are measured through profit or loss.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, no derivatives were held to hedge foreign exchange risk.\n\nCash and cash equivalents are held in the following currencies:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR | 31 12 2023 | 31 12 2022 |\n|---------------------|------------|------------|\n| EUR                 | 581,691    | 552,806    |\n| PLN                 | 36,205     | 33,186     |\n| RON                 | 26,751     | 32,956     |\n| HUF                 | 32,353     | 17,790     |\n| CZK                 | 8,490      | 6,578      |\n| RSD                 | 11,585     | 5,328      |\n| Other               | 44         | 4,106      |\n| Total               | 697,119    | 652,750    |\n\n#### 7.2.5 Interest rate risk\n\nAs an international corporation, IMMOFINANZ Group is exposed to the risk of interest rate fluctuations on real estate submarkets. Increases in interest rates can have a negative impact on Group earnings by increasing the cost of floating rate financing.\n\nA change in interest rates has a direct influence on financial results through its impact on floating rate financing. IMMOFINANZ Group limits the risk associated with rising interest rates – which would lead to higher interest expense and a decline in financial results – through the use of fixed interest rate financing contracts and derivative financial instruments (above all swaps). These derivative financial instruments are accounted for as stand-alone derivatives and not as hedging instruments in the sense of IFRS 9.\n\nThe following table shows the classification of financial liabilities by type of interest rate:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                          | 31 12 2023 | 31 12 2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Fixed interest financial liabilities         | 986,990    | 1,063,776  |\n| Floating rate financial liabilities          | 3,296,541  | 3,103,694  |\n| Total interest-bearing financial liabilities | 4,283,531  | 4,167,470  |\n\nOf the floating rate financial liabilities, a nominal value of EUR 3,088.4 million (31 December 2022: EUR 2,561.1 million) is hedged through interest rate swaps. This results in a fixed interest rate based on the combined interest effect of the financial liability and the derivative. Financial liabilities with a nominal value of EUR 19.9 million (31 December 2022: EUR 139.9 million) are hedged with caps.\n\n{230}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following table shows the fair values and conditions of all derivative financial instruments that were purchased and held as of 31 December 2023 to hedge interest rates:\n\n|

for derivatives outstanding as of the balance sheet date. The fair value represents the amount that the respective company would receive or be required to pay if the transaction were terminated as of the balance sheet date.\n\nA change in the market interest rate will influence the valuation of interest rate derivatives. Net present value calculations based on the DCF method – which is also used to value derivatives – discount future cash flows with current interest rate curves to determine market value. Rising interest rates lead to a higher discount factor and to a reduction in the present value of the derivative. Sensitivity analyses are used to illustrate the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations. They show the effects of changes in market interest rates on market values and interest payments as well as interest income and expense.\n\nThe following sensitivity analysis shows the effects of a change in the interest rate level on the fair value of the interest rate derivatives. An increase, respectively decrease of 50 and 100 basis points was assumed. The fair values exclude both accrued interest and credit risk premiums.\n\n{231}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Other Disclosures\n\n| Sensitivity of derivatives                    |            | Interest rate        |                       |  |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--|\n| All amounts in TEUR                           | 31 12 2023 | ∆ 50 basis<br>points | ∆ 100 basis<br>points |  |\n| Fair value based on increase in interest rate | 122,405    | 176,734              | 229,356               |  |\n| Fair value based on decrease in interest rate | 122,405    | 66,310               | 8,444                 |  |\n\n| Sensitivity of derivatives                    |            | Interest rate                  |                                 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| All amounts in TEUR                           | 31 12 2022 | $\\triangle$ 50 basis<br>points | $\\triangle$ 100 basis<br>points |\n| Fair value based on increase in interest rate | 241,190    | 287,502                        | 333,000                         |\n| Fair value based on decrease in interest rate | 241,190    | 192,030                        | 142,099                         |\n\nA further sensitivity analysis shows the influence of floating interest rates on the interest expense associated with financial liabilities.

The current financing receivables generally carry fixed interest rates and, consequently, they carry no or only limited interest rate risk.\n\n{232}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 7.2.6 Capital management\n\nThe goal set by IMMOFINANZ Group's management is to protect the Group's short-, medium- and long-term liquidity and to create and maintain a strong capital base in order to earn the trust of investors, creditors and the markets and safeguard the Group's sustainable positive development. The Executive Board regularly monitors the development of the share price, the discount of the share price to net asset value (net tangible assets, NTA), and the amount of recommended dividend payments to the shareholders of IMMOFINANZ AG.\n\nThe Group's capital structure is determined by financial liabilities and by equity (excluding treasury shares) of EUR 7,953.3 million. IMMOFINANZ Group intends to further optimise its capital structure by arranging for new financing and by terminating, extending or restructuring older financing. The average financing costs for IMMOFINANZ, including derivatives used for interest rate hedging, equalled 2.9% in 2023 (2022: 2.6%).\n\nThe Executive Board monitors the Group's capital structure by means of the LTV ratio. This indicator shows the relation between financial liabilities less cash and cash equivalents and the value of the real estate portfolio plus properties held for sale. The LTV ratio equalled 42.2% as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 40.7%).\n\nGearing (secured and unsecured) and the interest coverage ratio also represent a minimum capital requirement by external stakeholders. All requirements were met during the 2023 financial year.\n\n## 7.3 Financial obligations\n\n#### 7.3.1 Contingent liabilities and guarantees\n\nContingent liabilities represent possible or existing obligations arising from past events, in cases where it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation (also see section 7.1).\n\nThe contingent liabilities arising from sureties, guarantees and other liabilities that are not recognised on IM-MOFINANZ Group's balance sheet are evaluated regularly with respect to the probability of their occurrence. If an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is neither sufficiently probable to require the recognition of a provision nor improbable, the obligations are recognised as contingent liabilities. The estimates are made by specialists based on market-related inputs (where possible) and expert opinions (in individual cases).\n\nA preliminary injunction over the shares in a Romanian subsidiary (carrying amount of net assets: EUR 92.4 million; 31 December 2022: EUR 85.9 million) was in effect as of 31 December 2023 and limits the power to dispose over these shares. The involved subsidiary remains under IMMOFINANZ Group's control and is included in the consolidated financial statements through full consolidation. Moreover, legal uncertainty can arise in connection with land ownership in individual East European countries (e.g. Romania).\n\nThe assessment of risks related to uncertainties over income tax treatments as of 31 December 2023 identified two issues in Germany and Poland. IMMOFINANZ Group evaluated the basis for the accounting treatment of the related tax risks by way of scenario analyses and estimates from the involved attorneys and tax advisors. This led to the conclusion that the recognised risks have been appropriately included since the start of the proceedings. Following these analyses, it is still assumed that the tax authorities will acknowledge the procedural uncertainties of EUR 16.3 million (31 December 2022: EUR 11.3 million) in favour of the taxpayer and cancel the findings by the fiscal authorities. Since the decisions of tax authorities in Austria and other countries are not easy to predict and the refund of payments previously made is not considered sufficiently probable for the recognition of a contingent receivable, these items were not included in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2023.\n\n{233}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 7.3.2 Other financial obligations\n\nThe following table shows the financial obligations arising from previously contracted construction services, maintenance and other contractual obligations for the construction or acquisition of properties:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                                                       | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Outstanding construction costs                                            | 32,534 | 40,241 |\n| Contracted maintenance                                                    | 3,538  | 3,833  |\n| Contractual obligations for the construction or acquisition of properties | 6,080  | 18,929 |\n| Total                                                                     | 42,152 | 63,003 |\n\nContractual obligations for the construction or acquisition of properties include EUR 6.1 million (31 December 2022: EUR 18.9 million) for S IMMO Group.\n\n## 7.4 Transactions with related parties\n\nRelated parties in the sense of IAS 24 include all subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates (see section 8.). In addition to persons who have a controlling or significant influence over IMMOFINANZ Group, related parties include the members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of IMMOFINANZ AG and CPI Property Group, as well as their close family members. CPI Property Group is also considered a related party due to its majority shareholding.\n\nAs part of the remuneration for the members of the Executive Board, IMMOFINANZ AG makes payments to APK Pensionskasse AG. These payments are related to company pensions for the Executive Board members and reflect standard market conditions. The contributions made in 2023 are reported in section 7.4.2.\n\nTransactions between fully consolidated subsidiaries are eliminated during the consolidation and are therefore not explained in detail.\n\nThe following transactions were carried out with the CPI Property Group in 2023:\n\n| All amounts in TEUR               | 31 12 2023 | 31 12 2022 |\n|-----------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Relations with CPI Property Group |            |            |\n| Receivables                       | 12,481     | 13,063     |\n| Liabilities                       | 39,364     | 342,871    |\n| All amounts in TEUR               | 2023       | 2022       |\n| Relations with CPI Property Group |            |            |\n| Other income                      | 2,536      | 6,577      |\n| Other expenses                    | -23,791    | -5,452     |\n| Interest income                   | 21         | 0          |\n| Interest expense                  | -12,072    | -190       |\n\nIMMOFINANZ AG concluded a framework service agreement with CPI Property Group S.A. which covers the provision of asset management services and administrative services (accounting, tax, controlling, HR, legal, financial, IT) by the local management companies of CPI Property Group S.A. for the local property companies of IMMOFINANZ AG in selected CEE countries. The details for the provision of these services and the amount of the service fees are regulated by implementing agreements concluded between the local CPI management companies and the local property holding companies of IMMOFINANZ AG in the Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary, Serbia, Croatia and Italy. Various transactions were also concluded with CPI Property Group in 2023. The information on these transactions is provided in section 2.3.\n\n{234}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### 7.4.1 Joint ventures and associates\n\n| All amounts in TEUR                 | 31 12 2023 | 31 12 2022 |\n|-------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Relations with associated companies |            |            |\n| Receivables                         | 0          | 2          |\n| Liabilities                         | 0          | 214        |\n| All amounts in TEUR                 | 2023       | 2022       |\n| Relations with associated companies |            |            |\n| Other income                        | 237        | 800        |\n| Other expenses                      | -2,581     | -2,895     |\n\nTransactions with joint ventures and associates are carried out at standard market prices and conditions. The financing for joint ventures is frequently arranged between IMMOFINANZ Group and its co-investors at a ratio that differs from the respective interest in capital.\n\n#### 7.4.2 Members of management in key positions\n\nThe members of management in key positions as defined in IAS 24 are active solely in the corporate bodies of IMMOFINANZ AG and include the following persons:\n\n#### Executive Board\n\nRadka Doehring – Executive Chairwoman since 1 May 2022 Pavel Měchura – Member since 16 June 2023\n\nDietmar Reindl – Member of the Executive Board, Property Management, up to 8 June 2022 Stefan Schönauer – Member of the Executive Board, Finance, up to 8 June 2022\n\n#### Supervisory Board\n\nMiroslava Greštiaková – Chairwoman since 31 March 2022 Martin Němeček – Vice-Chairman since 31 March 2022 Gayatri Narayan – Member up to 31 December 2023\n\nBettina Breiteneder – Chairwoman up to 31 March 2022 Sven Bienert – Vice-Chairwoman up to 31 March 2022 Michael Mendel – Vice-Chairman from 19 October 2021 to 31 March 2022 Dorothee Deuring – Member from 19 October 2021 to 31 March 2022 Stefan Guetter – Member from 19 October 2021 to 15 July 2022 Martin Matula – Member since 16 July 2022\n\n#### Members delegated to the Supervisory Board by the Works Council\n\nThe following persons were delegated to the Supervisory Board by the Works Council of IMMOFINANZ AG: Philipp Amadeus Obermair – Member Anton Weichselbaum – Member since 3 May 2023 Werner Ertelthalner – Member up to 3 May 2023\n\nRita Macskasi-Temesvary – Member from 19 October 2021 to 31 March 2022\n\n{235}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                              |                      |                    | 2023  |                      |                    | 2022  |\n|------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|-------|----------------------|--------------------|-------|\n| All amounts in TEUR          | Supervisory<br>Board | Executive<br>Board | Total | Supervisory<br>Board | Executive<br>Board | Total |\n| Short-term employee benefits | 230                  | 744                | 974   | 230                  | 2,035              | 2,265 |\n| Post-employment benefits     | -                    | 53                 | 53    | -                    | 175                | 175   |\n| Termination benefits         | -                    | -                  | -     | -                    | 6,097              | 6,097 |\n| Total                        | 230                  | 797                | 1,027 | 230                  | 8,307              | 8,537 |\n\nThe members of management in key positions received the following remuneration:\n\nThe short-term employee benefits for the members of the Executive Board comprise a fixed component (gross salary and compensation in kind) as well as a variable component (bonuses).\n\nThe amounts reported under post-employment benefits represent the contributions by IMMOFINANZ to a pension fund. These contributions result from defined contribution pension commitments to the members of the Executive Board, which were outsourced to a pension fund.\n\nThe Supervisory Board remuneration reported under short-term benefits reflects the expenses for the respective financial year. However, this remuneration is only paid out after the approval of the annual general meeting which decides on the release from liability of the Supervisory Board members. The members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board held a total of 300 shares as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 150 shares).\n\nNo advances or loans were granted to the members of the Executive Board or Supervisory Board. Moreover, there is no share-based payment for the Executive Board.\n\n## 7.5 Auditor's fees\n\nThe fees charged by Ernst & Young Österreich for services provided in 2023 comprise TEUR 670.3 (2022: Deloitte Österreich TEUR 440.7) for the audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements, TEUR 11.0 (2022: Deloitte Österreich TEUR 95.3) for other consulting services, TEUR 14.0 (2022: Deloitte Österreich TEUR 0.0) for tax advising and TEUR 20.7 (2022: Deloitte Österreich TEUR 0.0) for miscellaneous services.\n\n{236}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 7.6 Subsequent events\n\nThe Management Board of S IMMO AG approved the start of a share buyback programme on 9 January 2023 in accordance with § 65 (1) no. 8 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act. The buyback programme has a volume of up to 365,340 shares (which represent approximately 0.5% of the current share capital of S IMMO AG). The company currently holds 3,266,537 treasury shares (which represent approximately 4.44% of the current share capital of S IMMO AG). The programme started on 15 January 2024 and is expected to end on 31 March 2024.\n\nIMMOFINANZ successfully closed the sale of the Grand Center Zagreb office building to a Croatian real estate company on 8 February and sold two office properties on Dresdnerstrasse in Vienna's 20th district as of 15 March. On 21 March, S IMMO AG signed the contract for the sale of the Zagrebtower. The involved properties had a combined carrying amount of EUR 106.5 million as of 31 December 2023. These transactions represent a further step in the portfolio optimisation.\n\nS IMMO AG signed a non-binding letter of intent with Czech Property Investments, a.s. (CPI AS), a subsidiary of CPI Property Group S.A., on 27 February for the acquisition of a real estate portfolio in the Czech Republic. The portfolio consists of office and retail properties with roughly 134,600 sqm of rentable space and a net asset value of EUR 494.5 million. The annual rental income amounts to approximately EUR 28 million.\n\n{237}------------------------------------------------\n\n## <span id=\"page-237-0\"></span>8.

Release of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThese consolidated financial statements were completed and signed by the Executive Board of IMMOFINANZ AG on 27 March 2024 and subsequently distributed to the Supervisory Board.

Those standards require that we comply with International Standards on Auditing (ISA). Our responsibilities under those regulations and standards are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\" section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Austrian General Accepted Accounting Principles and professional requirements and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained until the date of this auditor's report is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion by this date.\n\n#### Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the fiscal year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nThe following are the key audit matters that we identified:\n\n{245}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Valuation of Investment Property\n\n*Risk* \n\nIMMOFINANZ AG reports investment properties in the amount of EUR 7,830.7 mio in its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023. Moreover, the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 report a negative revaluation result from standing investments and goodwill amounting to EUR – 352.2 mio.\n\nInvestment properties are measured based on valuation reports from external, independent valuation experts according to IAS 40 in connection with IFRS 13 at fair value.\n\nThe valuation of investment properties is subject to material assumptions and estimates. The material risk for every individual property exists when determining these assumptions and estimates such as the discount/capitalization rate and rental income. A minor change in these assumptions and estimates can have a material impact on the valuation of investment properties.\n\nThe respective disclosures relating to accounting policies and significant judgements, assumptions and estimates are shown in Section \"4.1 Investment property\" as well as \"5.8 Revaluation results from investment property and goodwill\" in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### *Consideration in the audit*\n\nTo address this risk, we have critically assessed the assumptions and estimates made by management and the external valuation experts and performed, among others, the following audit procedures with involvement of our internal property valuation experts:\n\n- Assessment of concept and design of the underlying property valuation process\n- Assessment of design and effectiveness of relevant key controls in the underlying process based on a sample\n- Assessment of the competence, capability and objectivity of the external valuation experts engaged by management\n- For selected property valuation reports: Assessment of the applied methods, assessment of the reasonableness of the underlying assumptions and estimates (eg. rental income, discount/capitalization rate, usable space, vacancy rate) by means of comparison with market data as well as comparison whether the fair values as per property valuation reports are withing our own developed range of fair values\n- Check of certain input-data as included in the valuation reports with data in the accounting system or underlying agreements\n- Assessment of the adequacy and completeness of the disclosures made in the consolidated financial statements by the management\n\n## Accounting for and valuation of acquisitions of real estate entities from related parties\n\n*Risk* \n\nIn the business year 2023, IMMOFINANZ AG acquired real estate entities from CPI Property Group. CPI Property Group is a related party in the meaning of IAS 24.\n\nThe purchase prices of the acquired real estate entities are based on property values determined by external valuation experts. To evaluate whether the contractual arrangements of the acquisitions are at arm's length, IMMOFINANZ AG engaged an additional independent external expert.\n\nRecognition and measurement of these acquisitions require the application of complex accounting rules, in particular the assessment of whether the transaction constitutes the acquisition of a business under IFRS 3 or is to be recognized as an acquisition of assets. The real estate values on which the purchase prices are based, are subject to material assumptions and estimates.\n\nThere is a risk that acquisitions are not accounted for according to the applicable accounting rules. In addition, the property values determined on which the purchase prices are based could be derived from inappropriate valuation assumptions and therefore lead to purchase prices that are not at arm's length.\n\n{246}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe respective disclosures relating to accounting policies and significant judgements, assumptions and estimates are shown in Section \"2.3 Acquisition of subsidiaries\" and \"7.4 Transactions with related parties\" in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### *Consideration in the audit*\n\nTo address this risk, we have critically assessed the assumptions and estimates made by management and the external valuation experts and performed, among others, the following audit procedures:\n\n- Analysis of the relevant contracts and documents to gain an understanding of the framework and conditions and assessment whether the transactions were recorded in accordance with the applicable accounting rules.\n- Assessment of the competence, capability and objectivity of the external experts engaged by management\n- Analysis and assessment of the external experts' assessment whether the acquisitions are at arm' length\n- Critical assessment of the change in property values between acquisition date and date of the consolidated financial statements\n- Assessment of the adequacy and completeness of the disclosures made in the consolidated financial statements by the management\n\n#### Other matter\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of IMMOFINANZ AG for the year ended December 31, 2022 were audited by another group auditor who expressed an unmodified opinion on those consolidated statements on March 24, 2023.\n\n#### Other Information\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report and the annual financial report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the Group's management report and the auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, to consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n#### Responsibilities of Management and the Audit Committee for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements under Section 245a Austrian Company Code UGB for them to present a true and fair view of the assets, the financial position and the financial performance of the Group and for such internal controls as management determines are necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.\n\n{247}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the EU regulation and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISA, always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the EU regulation and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISA, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.\n\n#### We also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n{248}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n## Comments on the Management Report for the Group\n\nPursuant to Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the management report for the Group is to be audited as to whether it is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and as to whether the management report for the Group was prepared in accordance with the applicable legal regulations.\n\nRegarding the consolidated non-financial statement contained in the group management report, it is our responsibility to examine whether it has been prepared, to read it and to evaluate whether it is, based on our knowledge obtained in the audit, materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the management report for the Group in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing for the audit of the management report for the Group.\n\n#### Opinion\n\nIn our opinion, the management report for the Group was prepared in accordance with the valid legal requirements, comprising the details in accordance with Section 243a Austrian Company Code UGB, and is consistent with the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### Statement\n\nBased on the findings during the audit of the consolidated financial statements and due to the thus obtained understanding concerning the Group and its circumstances no material misstatements in the management report for the Group came to our attention.\n\n{249}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Additional information in accordance with article 10 EU regulation\n\nWe were elected as auditor by the ordinary general meeting at May 3, 2023. We were appointed by the Supervisory Board on July 14, 2023. We are auditors since the financial year 2023.\n\nWe confirm that the audit opinion in the Section \"Report on the consolidated financial statements\" is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee referred to in article 11 of the EU regulation.\n\nWe declare that no prohibited non-audit services (article 5 par. 1 of the EU regulation) were provided by us and that we remained independent of the audited company in conducting the audit.\n\n{250}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Responsible Austrian Certified Public Accountant\n\nThe engagement partner is Alexander Wlasto, Certified Public Accountant.\n\nVienna, 27 March 2024\n\nErnst & Young\n\nWirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H.\n\nAlexander Wlasto mp Isabelle Vollmer mp\n\nWirtschaftsprüfer / Certified Public Accountant Wirtschaftsprüferin / Certified Public Accountant\n\nThis report is a translation of the original report in German, which is solely valid.

General Information\n\nThe annual financial statements of IMMOFINANZ AG (the company) as of 31 December 2023 were prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Austrian Commercial Code (\"Unternehmensgesetzbuch\") in the current version. The principles of correct accounting as well as the general objective of providing a true and fair view of the asset, financial and earnings position were observed.\n\nThis report covers the financial year of IMMOFINANZ AG from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023.\n\nStatements on IMMOFINANZ refer to IMMOFINANZ Group. This company is the parent company, as defined in § 189a no. 6 of the Austrian Commercial Code, of IMMOFINANZ Group. CPI Property Group (CPIPG), which is headquartered in Luxembourg, is the parent company which prepares consolidated financial statements for the largest circle of companies. CPIPG has been the majority shareholder of IMMOFINANZ since May 2022.\n\nIn accordance with § 223 (2) of the Austrian Commercial Code, the comparative prior year data are presented in EUR 1,000.\n\nThe company elected to utilise the option provided by § 223 (4) of the Austrian Commercial Code, which permits the inclusion of additional line items when their content is not covered by a required position\n\nThe income statement was prepared in accordance with the nature of expense method under which \"total costs\" are shown.\n\nThe principle of completeness was followed in preparing the annual financial statements.\n\nAssets and liabilities were valued individually, whereby valuation was based on the going concern principle.\n\nThe principle of prudence was followed, above all, through the recognition of only those profits realised as of the balance sheet date. The annual financial statements include all identifiable risks and impending losses which had arisen as of the balance sheet date.\n\nEstimates are based on prudent judgment. Experience-based statistics from similar transactions were included in these estimates where available.\n\n## 2. Accounting and Valuation Principles\n\nAll intangible assets were purchased for financial consideration. These assets are carried at acquisition cost, less scheduled straight-line amortisation that is based on the expected useful life of the respective asset. No impairment losses were recognised.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are carried at acquisition cost, less scheduled straight-line depreciation. As in previous years, no impairment losses were required.\n\n{257}------------------------------------------------\n\nDepreciation and amortisation for the various asset additions and disposals in the reporting year are calculated beginning with the month of acquisition, respectively terminated in the month of disposal.\n\nLow-value assets are written off in full in the year of purchase or production in accordance with § 204 (1a) of the Austrian Commercial Code.\n\nFinancial assets are carried at cost, less any necessary impairment losses. The impairment testing of shares in subsidiaries, loans granted to subsidiaries, and investments in other companies involves comparing the respective carrying amount with the equity owned plus any undisclosed reserves in the individual properties (after the deduction of deferred taxes) at fair value. Each subsidiary is valued individually and, therefore, the valuation also reflects the total reported by the Group parent company, IMMOFINANZ AG. Investments in other companies are carried at cost, less any necessary impairment losses.\n\nWrite-ups are recognised to financial assets when the reasons for an impairment loss cease to exist.\n\nReceivables are carried at their nominal amount less any necessary impairment losses. The calculation of impairment losses to Group receivables is based on the fair value of equity in the financed company, similar to the valuation of the shares in subsidiaries. If the financial statements of a borrower show negative equity (at fair value), an appropriate impairment loss is recognised.\n\nNegative interest is reported on a separate line under \"other interest and similar income\".\n\nLiabilities are carried at their settlement amount.\n\nTax provisions are recognised, in particular, for obligations arising from the group tax agreement and represent the nominal amount.\n\nAll foreign currency transactions are translated at the average exchange rate in effect on the transaction date. The measurement of foreign currency receivables and liabilities as of the balance sheet date is based on the applicable average exchange rate in effect on that date in keeping with the principle of conservatism. Any resulting exchange rate losses are recognised to profit or loss in the applicable financial year.\n\nIn accordance with § 198 (9) and (10) of the Austrian Commercial Code, deferred taxes are recognised in agreement with the balance sheet-oriented concept and without discounting at the current corporate tax rate of 23%. A net amount based on the total difference method is calculated for the differences between the carrying amounts of assets, provisions, liabilities, prepaid expenses and deferred charges and deferred income under commercial law and tax law, in cases where these differences are expected to decrease in later financial years or lead to tax relief in the future. Deferred tax assets are also recognised for existing tax loss carryforwards at an amount equal to the available deferred tax liabilities, in accordance with the 75% limit on the utilisation of losses. Current forecasts provide sufficient substantial indications of future taxable gains, and the option for the recognition of additional loss carryforwards was therefore exercised as of 31 December 2023.\n\n{258}------------------------------------------------\n\n## 3. Notes to the Balance Sheet\n\n### Assets\n\n#### Non-current assets\n\nThe development of non-current assets is shown on the attached schedule.\n\nThe following useful lives are used to calculate scheduled straight-line depreciation and amortisation for noncurrent assets:\n\n|                               | Useful life in years |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Intangible assets             | 3–10                 |\n| Property, plant and equipment | 2–10                 |\n\nThe following section provides information on the shares in subsidiaries and investments in other companies:\n\nThe most important items included under shares in subsidiaries represent the shares in IMBEA IMMOEAST Beteiligungsverwaltung GmbH with a carrying amount of EUR 1,214,355,093.00 (31 December 2022: TEUR 1,773,388).\n\nIn 2023, SC Czech AGL s.r.o. received a contribution of EUR 77.6 million (2022: IMMOFINANZ Services Czech Republic s.r.o. EUR 133.3 million).\n\nThe impairment losses recognised to shares in subsidiaries amounted to EUR 671.7 million and resulted primarily from a write-down of EUR 108.1 million to the wholly owned subsidiary IMMOWEST Immobilien Anlagen GmbH and a distribution-based write-down of EUR 559.0 million to the wholly owned subsidiary IMBEA IMMOEAST Beteiligungsverwaltung GmbH (2022: impairment losses of EUR 118.5 million; related chiefly to IMMOWEST Immobilien Anlagen GmbH at EUR 70.7 million and to IMBEA IMMOEAST Beteiligungsverwaltung GmbH at EUR 47.8 million).\n\nThe most important item under loans granted to subsidiaries is the loan to Warsaw Spire Tower Sp.z.o.o. with a carrying amount of EUR 102,022,549.15 (31 December 2022: TEUR 100,149). The additions and reductions to loans granted to subsidiaries consist primarily of drawdowns and repayments during the 2023 financial year. Of the total loans granted to subsidiaries, EUR 0.00 (31 December 2022: TEUR 0) is due within one year.\n\nIMMOFINANZ AG purchased 19,499,437 bearer shares of S IMMO AG (in short: S IMMO) on 18 April 2018 and, as a result of this transaction, held an investment of approximately 29.14% in this company. The closing took place on 21 September 2018. The acquisition costs, including ancillary expenses, totalled EUR 390.7 million. A capital increase by S IMMO AG reduced this holding to approximately 26.5%.\n\nIMMOFINANZ AG acquired 17,305,012 shares in S IMMO from its core shareholder, CPI Property Group on 27 December 2022 and, in doing so, raised its holding to a majority investment of 50% plus one share in S IMMO. The acquisition costs, including ancillary expenses, totalled EUR 338.0 million (i.e. EUR 19.5 per S IMMO share). This transaction resulted in the reclassification from investments in other companies to shares in subsidiaries during 2022. The carrying amount of the investment in S IMMO equalled EUR 728.6 million as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 728.6 million).\n\nNon-current securities include shares in the Vienna Stock Exchange corporation with a value of EUR 1,000,699.26 (31 December 2022: TEUR 1,001).\n\nOther originated loans include EUR 145,000.00 (31 December 2022: TEUR 650) which are due within one year.\n\n{259}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Current assets\n\n#### Receivables\n\nReceivables from subsidiaries are classified as current when a specific payment term was not defined.

IMMOFINANZ AG serves as the lead company of this group. The lead company and the members of the tax group concluded an agreement for the settlement of taxes, which was amended in 2011/12. In accordance with the amended agreement, each member with positive results must pay a tax charge to the lead company. The charge equals 24% of the assessment base and is based on the tax rate defined in § 22 (1) of the Austrian Corporate Income Tax Act. Any losses by the group members are registered and can be offset in full against taxable profit recorded by the respective member in subsequent years. Group members with registered tax losses are not required to make payments to the lead company; no payments for (negative) charges are made by the lead company to the group members.\n\nS IMMO Group also had a corporate tax group pursuant to § 9 of the Austrian Corporate Income Tax Act with S IMMO AG as the lead company of this group. This tax group was integrated in the IMMOFINANZ tax group during 2023. Based on the tax assessment agreement concluded between the IMMOFINANZ AG and S IMMO companies, S IMMO AG with its subsidiaries forms a separate accounting entity for the tax charge. If S IMMO AG generates positive results, it is required to pay a (positive) tax charge to the head of the group equal to 20% of the assessment base. The generation of positive results by the S IMMO group members results in the payment of a (positive) tax charge to S IMMO AG equal to 24% of the assessment base. Losses incurred by the tax subgroup, respectively by the S IMMO group members are registered and can be offset in full against taxable profit recorded by the respective tax subgroup or S IMMO group member in subsequent years. Payments by S IMMO AG to the lead company or by an S IMMO group member to S IMMO AG are not required when registered losses are utilised. No payments for (negative) charges are made by the lead company to S IMMO AG or by S IMMO AG to the S IMMO group members.\n\n{265}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Related party transactions as defined in § 238 no. 12 of the Austrian Commercial Code\n\nThe market conformity of transactions with related parties and persons is documented and regularly monitored.\n\n## Minimum taxation in the sense of § 238 no. 3a of the Austrian Commercial Code\n\nIn December 2022, the member states of the European Union approved an EU directive on the implementation of a global minimum tax for multinational enterprise groups and large-scale domestic groups in the Union (EU Directive No. 2022/2523 from 14 December 2022). The guideline required implementation by the EU member states into national law by 31 December 2023 with enactment as of 1 January 2024. The directive calls for an additional tax on profits that are taxed at an effective tax rate of less than 15%.\n\nThis EU directive was implemented in Austria as of 1 January 2024 through the Minimum Tax Reform Act, Federal Gazette No. 187/2023 (\"Mindestbesteuerungsreformgesetz BGBl 187/2023\").\n\nThe takeover of IMMOFINANZ AG and S IMMO AG by CPI Property Group S.A. in 2022 resulted in total revenues that exceeded the threshold of EUR 750 million. IMMOFINANZ AG and the IMMOFINANZ Group companies are subject to the provisions of the Minimum Tax Reform Act. CPI Property Group S.A. is the ultimate parent company of IMMOFINANZ AG and the IMMOFINANZ Group companies.\n\nHowever, IMMOFINANZ AG is classified as a parent company in part ownership because over 20% of its shares are held by parties outside the Group. IMMOFINANZ AG is therefore subject to the provisions of the Minimum Tax Reform Act on the low-taxed business units under its control and is required to pay a minimum tax in Austria.\n\nAll major countries (with the exception of Poland) where IMMOFINANZ Group is active have enacted national tax regulations for minimum taxation in accordance with the EU directive which took effect at the end of 2022. These countries have implemented the regulations through a national top-up tax that takes effect as of 1 January 2024. It is expected that top-up tax will be chargeable to the IMMOFINANZ Group companies in Hungary (9%), Cyprus (12.5%), Croatia (10%, resp. 18%), Poland (9%, resp. 19%) and Bulgaria (10%) because the applicable nominal tax rates in these countries are currently below 15%. It is also expected that, in the end, a national top-up tax will be introduced in all countries.\n\nIMMOFINANZ AG can require compensation from the other business units for the minimum tax it pays in line with the regulations defined by company law but no compensatory agreements have been concluded to date.\n\nThe quantitative effects from the application of the Minimum Tax Reform Act are currently under evaluation. Due to the complexity of the analyses and the fact that the necessary reporting processes must still be developed, the effects cannot be reliably estimated at the present time.\n\nIn accordance with § 198 (10) sentence 3 no. 4 of the Austrian Commercial Code, deferred taxes arising from the application of the Minimum Tax Reform Act or a comparable foreign law were not recognised in 2023. No current taxes from the minimum taxation regulations were recognised as of 31 December 2023 in the absence of application.\n\nIMMOFINANZ AG held tax loss carryforwards totalling EUR 2,685,324,944.00 as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: TEUR 2,890,764).\n\nIMMOFINANZ AG also held deductible temporary partial depreciation charges on investments (\"Siebentelabschreibung\") totalling EUR

|\n\n{272}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Non-financial performance indicators / environmental issues\n\nIMMOFINANZ is committed to the responsible use of natural resources, the use of climate-friendly technologies, a systematic energy savings strategy, the refurbishment of building substance which is worth preserving and the construction of efficient new buildings. This reduces operating costs and emissions and also contributes to environmental protection and tenant satisfaction.\n\nCorporate goals include the steady reduction of energy consumption as well as an increase in the energy efficiency of the standing investment portfolio and the related energy savings. The environmental impact is estimated prior to the start of new activities or projects, and the results of these analyses are integrated in the decision process. Plans also include the gradual expansion of sustainability certification for development projects and standing investments. These certifications reduce environmental risks and help to improve the environmentally friendly use of space and achieve an increase in efficiency.\n\n### D. Information on Equity\n\nThe share capital of IMMOFINANZ equalled EUR 138,669,711.00 as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 138,669,711.00) and was divided into 138,669,711 zero par value shares with voting rights, each of which represented a proportional share of EUR 1.00 in share capital.\n\n### Treasury Shares\n\n#### Treasury shares held\n\nIMMOFINANZ held 695,585 treasury shares with a proportional share of EUR 695,585.00 in share capital as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 695,585 treasury shares with a proportional share of EUR 695,585.00 in share capital). These treasury shares represented approximately 0.5% of share capital.\n\nNo treasury shares were purchased or sold during the 2023 financial year.\n\n#### Authorisations of the annual general meeting to purchase and sell treasury shares\n\nThe annual general meeting on 3 May 2023 authorised the Executive Board, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to repurchase the company's shares in accordance with § 65 (1) no. 8 and (1a) and (1b) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act at an amount equalling up to 10% of share capital during a period of 30 months. The shares may be purchased over the stock exchange or over the counter. The Executive Board was also authorised, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the proportional subscription rights of shareholders.\n\nThe Executive Board was also authorised, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to sell or use treasury shares in another manner than over the stock exchange or through a public offering in accordance with § 65 (1b) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act during a period of five years, whereby the proportional subscription rights of shareholders can be excluded.\n\nThe authorisation for the purchase and sale of treasury shares has not been used to date and is therefore available in full.\n\n## Authorised capital\n\nThe annual general meeting on 3 May 2023 authorised the Executive Board, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, pursuant to § 169 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act to increase the company's share capital by up to EUR 69,334,855.00 through the issue of up to 69,334,855 new shares in exchange for cash or contributions in kind. The authorisation is valid up to 21 July 2028. The Executive Board is also authorised, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the subscription rights of shareholders in full or in part. The \n\n{273}------------------------------------------------\n\nshares issued based on this authorisation in exchange for cash contributions and under the exclusion of shareholders' subscription rights may not exceed EUR 13,866,971.00, which represents roughly 10% of the company's share capital at the time the resolution was passed by the annual general meeting.\n\nThis authorisation to increase share capital has not been used to date and is therefore available in full.\n\n## Convertible bonds and conditional capital\n\nThe annual general meeting on 3 May 2023 authorised the Executive Board, with the consent of the Supervisory Board, pursuant to § 174 (2) of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act to issue convertible bonds up to a total nominal value of EUR 618,092,498.00 which are connected with exchange and/or subscription rights for up to 69,334,855 bearer shares of the company with a proportional share of EUR 69,334,855.00 in share capital. These convertible bonds may be issued in multiple tranches and within a period of five years. Moreover, the Executive Board was authorised to determine all other conditions as well as the issue and exchange procedures for the convertible bonds. The convertible bonds can be issued in exchange for cash or contributions in kind. The subscription rights of shareholders are excluded.\n\nShare capital was conditionally increased, pursuant to § 159 (2) no. 1 of the Austrian Stock Corporation Act, by up to EUR 69,334,855.00 through the issue of up to 69,334,855 new bearer shares. The purpose of this conditional capital increase is the issue of shares to the holders of the convertible bonds which were issued in accordance with a resolution of the annual general meeting on 3 May 2023.\n\nThe authorisation for the issue of convertible bonds has not been used to date and is therefore available in full.\n\n## Change of control provisions\n\n#### Corporate bond 2020–2027\n\nThe terms and conditions of the corporate bond 2020–2027 (XS2243564478) issued in October 2020 entitle the bondholders to terminate their bonds and demand immediate repayment at 101% of the nominal value plus accrued interest as of the respective date when a controlling investment (also taking into account the reduced threshold defined by the articles of association) in the company, as defined in the Austrian Takeover Act, is acquired and results in a mandatory takeover offer. Details on these provisions are provided in the issue terms of the bonds.\n\n#### Property financing\n\nThe material property financing agreements concluded by IMMOFINANZ and its subsidiaries generally include standard market cancellation rights for the lenders in the event of a change of control.\n\n#### Corporate credit line\n\nIMMOFINANZ concluded an unsecured, revolving corporate credit line of EUR 100.0 million. It includes a termination right in the event of a change of control. As of 31 December 2023, the corporate credit line had not been used and is therefore available in full.\n\n#### Bonds issued by S IMMO AG\n\nS IMMO is included through full consolidation based on the investment of 50% plus one share held by IMMOFINANZ (for information on full consolidation, also see section 2.3 in the consolidated financial statements). Following is a listing of the bonds issued by S IMMO which include change-of-control clauses that take effect in connection with an indirect change of control at the IMMOFINANZ level.\n\nThe following bonds issued by S IMMO include change-of-control provisions: the 3.25% S IMMO Bond 2015–2025 issued in April 2015 (volume as of 31 December 2023: EUR 15,890,000.00), the 3.25% S IMMO Bond 2015–2027 issued in April 2015 (volume as of 31 December 2023: EUR 34,199,000.00), the 1.75% S IMMO Bond 2018–2024 (volume as of 31 December 2023: EUR 100,000,000.00) and the 2.875% S IMMO Bond 2018–2030 both issued in February 2018 (volume as of 31 December 2023: \n\n{274}------------------------------------------------\n\nEUR 50,000,000.00), the 1.875% S IMMO Bond 2019–2026 issued in May 2019 (volume as of 31 December 2023: EUR 150,000,000.00), the 2.0% S IMMO Bond 2019–2029 issued in October 2019 (volume as of 31 December 2023: EUR 100,000,000.00), the 1.75% S IMMO Green Bond 2021–2028 issued in February 2021 (volume as of 31 December 2023: EUR 70,449,500.00), the 1.25% S IMMO Green Bond 2022–2027 issued in January 2022 (volume as of 31 December 2023: EUR 25,058,500.00), and the 5.5% S IMMO Green Bond 2023–2028 issued in July 2023 (volume as of 31 December 2023: EUR 75,000,000.00). The terms and conditions of the bonds issued in 2014 and 2015 and the green bonds issued in 2021, 2022 and 2023 entitle the bondholders, in the event of a change of control, to put their bonds and demand immediate repayment. The terms and conditions of the bonds issued in 2018 and 2019 entitle the bondholders, in the event of a change of control, to put their bonds if the change of control materially impairs the ability of S IMMO to meet its obligations under the bond. A change of control as defined in the bond terms and conditions occurs when one or more persons acting in consort, or a third party or persons acting for such person or persons, at any time, directly or indirectly (i) hold(s) more than 50% of the voting rights connected with the issuer's shares (excluding the maximum voting right) or (ii) has(have) the right to determine the majority of the issuer's management board members and/or shareholder representatives on the issuer's supervisory board. According to the terms and conditions of the bonds issued in 2019, a change of control is also assumed to take place when the maximum voting right is legally cancelled and one or more persons acting in consort, or a third party or persons acting for such person or persons, at any time, directly or indirectly, has(have) purchased more than 30% of the voting rights connected with the issuer's shares. According to the terms and conditions of the green bonds issued in 2021, 2022 and 2023, a change of control is also assumed to take place when one or more persons acting in consort, or a third party or persons acting for such person or persons, at any time, directly or indirectly, acquire(s) a controlling interest as defined in the Austrian Takeover Act which triggers a mandatory takeover offer.\n\n#### Executive Board und Supervisory Board\n\nThe Executive Board contracts with Radka Doehring and Pavel Měchura do not include a change-of-control clause.\n\nThere are no such agreements for the members of the Supervisory Board or for employees.\n\nThe company has no other significant agreements which would enter into force, change or terminate in the event of a change of control that results from a takeover bid.\n\n### Amendments to the articles of association, board appointments and dismissals\n\nIn accordance with § 21 of the articles of association, the annual general meeting passes its resolutions based on a simple majority of the votes cast and, for resolutions that require a majority of capital, based on a simple majority of the share capital represented at the time of voting, unless legal regulations require a different majority. The same applies to amendments to the articles of association and to the premature dismissal of members from the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe person chairing the respective meeting casts the deciding vote in the event of a tie in voting on the Supervisory Board in accordance with the articles of association. This also applies to the election to and dismissal of members from the Executive Board.\n\nThe corporate governance report included in this annual report, which was expanded to include the consolidated corporate governance report, is available on the company's website under https://immofinanz.com.\n\n{275}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Significant holdings\n\nInformation reported to the company, directors' dealings notifications and other disclosures show the following investments and attributed voting rights which exceeded 4% of share capital as of 31 December 2023:\n\n- Radovan Vitek (via CPI Property Group S.A.): over 75% (based on a notification dated 21 December 2023 and a Directors' Dealings report from 22 December 2023)\n- Klaus Umek (via Petrus Advisers Investments Fund L.P.): 5.46% (1.06% in shares and 4.40% in financial/other instruments; based on a notification dated 22 December 2023)\n\n## E. Research and Development\n\nTechnological and social transformation as well as the fight against climate change have an influence on the real estate sector. In order to be optimally positioned to also offer efficient and profitably manageable property solutions in the future, IMMOFINANZ Group monitors the changes in work processes as well as the influence of environmental factors and tenants' demands on space and building concepts. The focus on training and continuing education has been increased to support internal innovation strength and sustainability efforts. IMMOFINANZ Group also maintains regular contacts with other companies and organisations and is a member of numerous associations and institutions like IG Lebenszyklus, the Austrian Council of Shopping Places and the Green Building Council. Apart from these diverse activities, IMMOFINANZ Group did not invest any funds in 2023 that could be classified as conventional research and development. This type of information is therefore not provided.\n\n## F. Branch Offices\n\nIMMOFINANZ AG has no branch offices.\n\n## G. Financial Instruments and Risk Reporting\n\nAs an international real estate investor, property owner and project developer, IMMOFINANZ is exposed to a variety of general and branch-specific risks in its business operations. An integrated risk management process provides the Group with a sound basis for the timely identification of potential risks and the assessment of the potential consequences.\n\nRisks represent the possibility of deviating from planned targets as the result of \"coincidental\" disruptions caused by the unpredictable nature of the future. In this connection, negative variances are considered risks in the strict sense of the term and positive variances are seen as opportunities.\n\n## Principles of integrated risk management\n\nThe structure of risk management is based on the rules of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code and the integrated framework of the COSO ERM\\*, an internationally recognised concept for the design of risk management systems.\n\nBased on the hedging and management instruments currently in use, no material risks can be identified at the present time that would endanger the company's standing as a going concern. The overall risk situation for IMMOFINANZ and for the entire market in 2023 was influenced by the challenging political and macroeconomic environment. The major risk categories are discussed in greater detail at the end of this risk report.\n\n{276}------------------------------------------------\n\nIMMOFINANZ has anchored the procedures for handling risk in a Group-wide risk management system, which is integrated in business practices and reporting paths and has a direct influence on processes and strategic decisions. Risk management takes place at all levels through internal guidelines, reporting systems and the internal control system (ICS) which is monitored by the internal audit department.\n\n#### Monitoring and control of the risk management system\n\nThe risk management system is monitored and controlled through two corporate channels. On the one hand, internal audit evaluates the effectiveness of risk management and contributes to its improvement. On the other hand, the auditor reviews the functionality of risk management in accordance with C-Rule 83 of the Austrian Corporate Governance Code (in the version released in January 2023) and reports to the Executive Board on the results of this analysis.\n\n#### Evaluation of the functionality of the risk management system\n\nErnst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H., Vienna, evaluated the effectiveness of IMMOFINANZ's risk management system during the period from December 2023 to February 2024. This analysis covered the design and implementation of the measures and organisational procedures instituted by the company, but not their application in the sense of operating effectiveness. The conclusions by Ernst & Young indicated that the risk management system instituted by IMMOFINANZ as of 31 December 2023 – based on the COSO comprehensive framework for corporate risk management – is functional.\n\n### Structure of risk management\n\nThe goal of risk management is to implement the strategy defined by the Executive Board with a minimum of risk. The Group's strategic goals are transferred to the operating processes where the measures for the identification, prevention and management of risks are located.\n\nImage /page/276/Figure/8 description: The image shows an organizational chart titled \"Responsibilities and reporting paths\". The chart shows a hierarchy with the \"Supervisory Board\" at the top, followed by the \"Executive Board\". Below the \"Executive Board\" are two boxes, one labeled \"Department heads/Country management\" and the other labeled \"Risk management\". Both of these boxes have \"Employees\" listed below them.\n\n{277}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Executive Board is responsible for risk management in IMMOFINANZ Group and defines the corporate goals and related risk strategy.\n\nRisk management is a staff function which reports directly to the Executive Board. It monitors the corporate risks that are not related to specific business areas, aggregates risk data and reports, and actively supports the business areas and country organisations in the identification of risks and economically feasible countermeasures. Risk management reports regularly to the Executive Board and quarterly to the Supervisory Board.\n\nAt the country organisation level, the heads of the respective units are responsible for risk management. Risk positions are reported to the Executive Board at least once each quarter by the business area and country managers. Acute risks are reported immediately to the Executive Board.\n\n#### Risk management process\n\nImage /page/277/Figure/5 description: The image shows a flowchart of risk management steps. The first step is \"Risk identification\", followed by \"Risk assessment\", then \"Risk management\", and finally \"Risk controlling\". Each step has a brief description associated with it.

IMMOFINANZ has defined a broad range of measures to address and counter risks. These measures represent an integral part of all corporate processes and, consequently, form the basis for the reduction of risk.\n\n| Risk category                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Countermeasures                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Business risks                       | These risks are related to the general framework condi-<br>tions for business activities and exceed the scope of<br>property-specific risks.                                                                                                                | These risks are countered by strategic decisions at the<br>corporate level.                                                                                                                                                      |\n|                                      | Financial risks are related to lenders or the terms and<br>conditions for the provision of cash and cash equiva<br>lents (see section 7.2 in the consolidated financial<br>statements).                                                                     | The continuous monitoring of asset and liability posi-<br>tions as well as proactive analyses form the basis for<br>strategic measures to safeguard the company's financial<br>strength.                                         |\n|                                      | Operational risk can arise through detrimental actions<br>by corporate bodies and/or employees to the disad-<br>vantage of the company.                                                                                                                     | The company's activities are separated into individual<br>processes and relevant process steps are controlled in-<br>ternally.                                                                                                   |\n|                                      | Other risks represent individual risks with a Group-wide<br>impact.                                                                                                                                                                                         | These risks are countered by strategic decisions at the<br>corporate level.                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Risks of improper business practices | IMMOFINANZ is committed to responsible and trans-<br>parent actions and to compliance with legal rules and<br>regulations.

The goal of the ICS is to prevent or identify errors and therefore allow for early correction. The ICS also supports compliance with major legal directives and the business policies defined by the Executive Board.\n\nThe ICS is integrated in all corporate processes. Its key features involve the appropriate segregation of duties, the application of the four-eyes principle within the framework of relevant corporate processes, compliance with internal guidelines (e.g. IMMOFINANZ's IFRS accounting manual), the review of accounting data by Group controlling for correctness, plausibility and completeness, the integration of preventive and detective controls in processes as well as automatic key controls through specific software settings.\n\n#### Monitoring by internal audit\n\nInternal audit is responsible for the independent review of the effectiveness of the ICS and, in this way, contributes to its quality assurance. This department also evaluates the effectiveness of risk management and supports its continuous improvement. Based on an annual audit plan approved by the Supervisory Board, the internal audit department independently and regularly reviews operating processes and business transactions. The priorities for this schedule are defined in accordance with risk criteria and organisational goals.\n\nThe results of the audits are reported to the IMMOFINANZ Executive Board on a regular basis and to the Supervisory Board twice each year. As part of an annual report, the internal audit department explains its activities and summarises the major audit areas and results.\n\n## Opportunity and risk position in 2023\n\nOverview of opportunities and risks as of 31 December 2023\n\nImage /page/279/Figure/9 description: The image shows a risk-opportunity matrix.

The bottom right quadrant is labeled \"Utilise opportunities\".\n\n{280}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Macroeconomic conditions (1)\n\nThe 2023 financial year was influenced by an increase in political tensions throughout the world. Armed conflicts resulted in individual cases and were accompanied by a negative impact on raw material markets and the disruption of international trading and logistics routes. The consequence was a further deterioration of the already weakening global economy. At the present time, the expansion of or increase in these conflicts carries the greatest inherent potential for risk. IMMOFINANZ Group is not directly affected by this potential development, but a possible impact on financial and transaction markets or the demand for rental properties cannot be excluded. These developments are the focus of regular monitoring and the best possible hedging of the related risks by IMMOFINANZ Group. Specific components of these risks are discussed in detail in the following paragraphs.\n\n#### Financial market risks (2)\n\nThe war in Ukraine triggered a sharp rise in inflation during 2022. The European Central Bank as well as central banks outside the eurozone reacted with a rapid and sizeable increase in interest rates during 2023, which continues to have a strong negative impact on the real estate branch today. On the one hand, this policy shift led to a substantial increase in interest expense for this business sector. IMMOFINANZ Group is continuing its hedging strategy in this context. The hedging-quota for financial liabilities equalled 95.1% at year-end 2023 (31 December 2022: 87.0%). On the other hand, borrowing has become much more difficult for the business sector. The after-effects were bankruptcies by real estate companies across Europe. The changing framework conditions on the capital markets reflected these effects, also in the area of asset allocation – which is discussed in greater detail under the following point.\n\n#### Liquidity risk on the real estate market (3)\n\nThe last few years were characterised by a low-interest policy. The prevailing negative interest rates led to the investment of enormous volumes of capital in real estate due to the lack of viable alternatives. This rising demand supported the construction industry and drove construction to new highs. The demand for properties in good locations frequently exceeded the offering by far. The following sharp rise in interest rates changed the framework conditions on financial markets, and investors are again able to choose from a larger range of alternatives. Even government bonds have become interesting for institutional investors due to the higher interest rates. The result has been a substantial decline in buyers' interest for real estate. IMMOFINANZ Group reduced its property developments early on and did not start any speculative new construction projects. The current expansion of the STOP SHOP retail parks in Croatia will continue as planned. The completed retail parks are fully rented on opening, and IMMOFINANZ Group therefore views the related risk as manageable. IMMOFINANZ Group is only affected by the decline in transaction volumes to a very limited extent. Its sale programme was announced and launched already in June 2022. IMMOFINANZ Group (including S IMMO) sold properties with a combined value of EUR 751 million in 2023. This programme covered, in particular, the sale of office and residential properties in Germany and one office property in Croatia by S IMMO, as well as the Bureau am Belvedere office building in Vienna, a small plot of land in Romania and land in Turkey by IMMOFINANZ. In addition, IMMOFINANZ sold six office properties and a hotel tower with gross rentable space totalling roughly 130,000 sqm to S IMMO. All these measures are part of the focused portfolio strategy that will form the basis for IMMOFINANZ to realise synergies and increase efficiency together with S IMMO.\n\n#### Risks from climate change (4)\n\nThe real estate sector is responsible for roughly one-third of global energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Major efforts are therefore directed to reducing this component through new regulations. IMMOFINANZ Group has gone to great lengths in recent years to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from its portfolio. Over the coming years, the company plans to increase its focus on measures to improve energy efficiency. The energy efficiency of buildings – together with energy generation – also plays a central role in the EU Taxonomy Regulation. For this reason, IMMOFINANZ Group has been installing photovoltaic equipment on its properties and plans to continue doing so in the coming years. This important contribution to decarbonisation is an integral part of the company's ESG strategy.\n\nIn the area of climate risks, modelling shows a stronger increase in the temperatures in the IMMOFINANZ Group core markets as well as a greater probability of longer dry periods. Both of these trends are integrated in building refurbishment projects and flow into project development analyses. Properties near the coasts in Poland and Croatia – and here, only a limited number of retail parks are involved – are exposed to the risk of rising sea levels. Natural hazards represent a further aspect since the models forecast an increasing danger of\n\n{281}------------------------------------------------\n\nforest fires due to the longer dry periods. This phenomenon is already visible in the Mediterranean region and will spread northward in the coming years. The related risks are addressed with construction measures that include a focus on the design and expansion of green areas and, in addition, all IMMOFINANZ Group properties are insured against natural hazards.\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group also sees opportunities in the area of biodiversity. Future plans include the replacement of water-intensive grassy areas with planting that supports biodiversity. These areas not only save water and energy but require less care and can help to achieve a slight reduction in operating costs.\n\n#### Legal proceedings (5)\n\nAs in the previous years, IMMOFINANZ Group is involved in restitution claims related to the VIVO! locations in Cluj and Constanţa. The proceedings related to the VIVO! Cluj resulted in a final judgment that rejected IMMOFINANZ Group's ownership title to the land. For the shopping center itself, all instances to date have confirmed IMMOFINANZ 's ownership. In the legal proceedings over the VIVO! Constanţa, witnesses have been called.\n\n#### Valuation risks (6)\n\nThe inflation rates in 2023 were the highest since the early 1970s. Central banks in the IMMOFINANZ Group core countries reacted by raising interest rates which, in turn, has increased the attractiveness of alternative investments as well as investors' expectations of higher returns from real estate. The result has been an increase in yields in nearly all submarkets. These rising expectations are reflected in lower market values and lead to the necessary recognition of write-downs.\n\nAn analysis of the successful transactions in 2023 shows a significant increase in the demand for EU taxonomyaligned properties and properties with a strong focus on ESG aspects. IMMOFINANZ Group is working to bring its entire property portfolio up to taxonomy-aligned standards. The necessary technical measures range from the installation of photovoltaic equipment to thermal refurbishment and the digitalisation of building technology. This will prevent rental risks such as a decline in demand or rentals and counter the loss of value in the standing investment portfolio. As part of its sustainable portfolio strategy, IMMOFINANZ Group wants to create an upward valuation potential for properties with high ESG standards – which will also improve the rental performance of these properties in the coming years.\n\nRevaluation results totalled EUR -376.8 million in 2023.\n\n#### IT risks (7)\n\nDigitalisation is also increasing in the real estate sector. Business processes must be accelerated and become more transparent to meet the growing reporting requirements. In this connection, IMMOFINANZ Group is currently working to upgrade its ERP system. Properties must also become \"smarter\" in the future. Electronic controls help to save energy, reduce emissions and lower operating costs. However, the digitalisation of standing investments is connected with additional costs which require appropriate resources.\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group has taken extensive precautions to protect its IT systems and places high priority on employee training. In addition, corporate processes are being optimised to guarantee the highest possible level of security. Based on the procedures already established, the risk to critical corporate processes can be considered low.\n\n#### Portfolio risks (8)\n\nThe occupancy rate in the standing investment portfolio equalled 92.2% as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: 92.9%). The retail properties were practically fully let at 98.7% (31 December 2022: 98.8%), and the occupancy rate in the office properties was stable at 88.4% (31 December 2022: 88.1%).\n\nThe development projects currently followed by IMMOFINANZ Group (property under construction) have a combined carrying amount of EUR 61.5 million (31 December 2022: EUR 126.6 million). The outstanding construction costs for these development projects totalled EUR 56.2 million at the end of 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 47.6 million). Pipeline projects, including real estate inventories, had a carrying amount of EUR 195.8 million as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 229.2 million).\n\n{282}------------------------------------------------\n\n## H. Outlook\n\n## Expected market environment\n\nHigh inflation, a rapid increase in interest rates, the collapse of the real estate transaction market and a generally weak economy were the determining factors in 2023. According to the experts, current macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions will prevent any changes in the challenging market environment during 2024. Economic growth in the eurozone is projected to be low at 1.2% based on an inflation rate that remains high at roughly 3.2%.\n\nThese developments also represent an uncertainty factor for the real estate market. Rising financing costs and pressure on property prices have a persistent negative effect. Inflation is still above the 2.0% target, which facilitates an increase in rents covered by indexed contracts but, at the same time, weakens consumers' purchasing power. Most experts only see a market recovery in the second half of 2024. IMMOFINANZ Group – with its flexible and resilient real estate products – believes it is well positioned in spite of the current challenging environment. We intend to consequently develop our core business as a real estate investor and work to further optimise the portfolio.\n\n## Property portfolio and sustainability\n\nRetail property acquisitions and completions in 2023 more than offset strategic sales, and the carrying amount of IMMOFINANZ Group's portfolio was only a slight -2% lower year-on-year at EUR 8.2 billion as of 31 December 2023. The standing investment portfolio totalled EUR 7.8 billion and included EUR 1.9 billion, or 24% of office properties, EUR 2.6 billion, or 33% of retail properties, and EUR 3.3 billion, or 42% for S IMMO\n\nOur portfolio strategy continues to rely on resilient and cost-efficient retail properties and innovative office solutions. They include the established myhive, STOP SHOP and VIVO! brands as well as complementary products and portfolios. We plan to expand the offering in our core countries over the medium term but in the current market environment, our main objective will be to strengthen the retail portfolio through our own development projects and selective acquisitions.\n\nThe optimisation programme for our portfolio is progressing. As part of our active portfolio management, we sold properties with a combined value of approximately EUR 751 million (including S IMMO) in 2023. The related activities in 2024 will continue to concentrate on the sale of lower yielding properties that bring attractive sale prices as well as non-strategic properties. The proceeds will be reinvested, as in the past, in valuecreating acquisitions and/or development projects.\n\nIMMOFINANZ as part of CPI Property Group, approved the Group-wide adjustment and standardisation of the ESG strategy in 2023, which covers ecological sustainability as well as social aspects and good corporate governance. Our goal is to make an extensive contribution to the sustainable development of the real estate branch by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the use of renewable energies, decreasing water consumption and improving the recycling rate. Our plans for 2024 include, among others, the further expansion of photovoltaic equipment at our properties. The green lease contracts introduced in 2023 have been implemented in all our core markets and will be offered to tenants as part of our rental activities.\n\n{283}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Financing and the capital market\n\nIMMOFINANZ Group has a very solid capital and financing structure with an equity ratio of 47.3%, a net loanto-value ratio of 42.1%, and cash and cash equivalents of EUR 697.1 million at the end of December 2023. An unsecured, revolving corporate credit line of EUR 100.0 million is also available. Roughly 95% of our financial liabilities are hedged against rising interest rates, and our goal is to continue this conservative financial policy. Gearing, based on the net LTV, should therefore remain at a conservative level over the medium term.\n\nOur focus in the current market environment lies primarily on long-term bank financing. For new financing as well as refinancing at the property level, we benefit from long-term, cooperative relationships with banks in our core markets. After the successful refinancing of approximately EUR 1 billion of bank liabilities in 2023, we are currently meeting with our financing banks to discuss the premature extension of expiring financing at the current market conditions.\n\nMost experts anticipate a reduction in key eurozone interest rates by the European Central Bank (ECB) in 2024. These prospects have recently led to a more optimistic mood in the real estate sector. Transactions could therefore increase during the second half of 2024 in a more attractive climate based on lower interest rates and stabilised yields.\n\n{284}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Close cooperation with CPIPG and S IMMO\n\nWork on the integration of IMMOFINANZ and S IMMO started in 2022. Under the direction of the CPI Property Group CPIPG), we bundled resources in asset and property management and in other service areas to optimise our organisational structures and significantly improve efficiency. These activities successfully continued with the signing of a framework agreement with S IMMO to evaluate further integration options. We have already realised synergies, including common service contracts and the standardisation of IT systems and processes. CPI Property Group, as the core shareholder of IMMOFINANZ, is actively supporting this process with an aim towards the identification and realisation of further synergies. In spite of this progress, our tenants remain our first priority. We intend to continue offering optimal property solutions in the future to further strengthen our leading position in the branch.\n\nThis outlook reflects the Executive Board's assessments as of 27 March 2024 and includes statements and forecasts concerning the future development of IMMOFINANZ Group. The forecasts represent estimates that are based on the information available at the present time. If the underlying assumptions do not occur or risks – as indicated in the risk report – materialise, actual results could differ from the statements made here.

These financial statements comprise the balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, the income statement for the fiscal year then ended and the notes.´\n\nBased on our audit the accompanying financial statements were prepared in accordance with the legal regulations and present fairly, in all material respects, the assets and the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and its financial performance for the year then ended in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\n\n#### Basis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the regulation (EU) no. 537/2014 (in the following \"EU regulation\") and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we comply with International Standards on Auditing (ISA). Our responsibilities under those regulations and standards are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\" section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Austrian General Accepted Accounting Principles and professional requirements and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained until the date of this auditor's report is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion by this date.\n\n#### Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the fiscal year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nThe following is the key audit matter that we identified:\n\n#### *Titel* Valuation of investments in and loans to subsidiaries as well as receivables from subsidiaries\n\n*Risk* The financial statements of IMMOFINANZ AG as of December 31, 2023 show material investments in subsidiaries (MEUR 3.182,4), loans to subsidiaries (MEUR 227,3) as well as receivables from subsidiaries (MEUR 302,9). Furthermore, the financial statements show impairment losses (MEUR 667,5) in the expenses arising from financial assets and impairment losses in relation to receivables against subsidiaries (MEUR 25,7) in other operating expenses.\n\n> All investments in and loans to subsidiaries as well as receivables from subsidiaries are tested for impairment. These impairment assessments require significant assumptions and estimates.\n\n> Due to the fact that most of the subsidiaries are real estate companies, the impairment test is based on a simplified entity value which is mainly influenced by the property valuation reports by external, independent valuation experts or already contractually agreed purchase prices. The material risk within the valuation reports exists when determining assumptions and estimates such as the discount/capitalization rate and rental income. A minor change in these assumptions and estimates can have a material impact on the valuation of investments in and loans to subsidiaries as well as receivables from subsidiaries.\n\n{286}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe respective disclosures relating to investments in and loans to affiliated companies are shown in Section \"2. Accounting and Valuation Principles\" and in Section \"3. Notes to the Balance Sheet\", the disclosures relating to impairment losses in Section \"4. Notes to the Income Statement\" in the financial statements as of December 31, 2023.\n\n*dit* \n\n*Considera-* To address this risk, we have critically assessed the assumptions and estimates made by *tion in the au-* management and the external valuation experts and performed, among others, the following audit procedures with involvement of our internal property valuation experts:\n\n- Assessment of concept and design of the underlying business process of the valuation of investments in and loans to subsidiaries as well as receivables from subsidiaries\n- Assessment of the applied methods and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations and supporting documentation for the valuation of investments in and loans to subsidiaries as well as receivables from subsidiaries\n- Assessment of design and effectiveness of relevant key controls in the property valuation process based on a sample\n- Assessment of the competence, capability and objectivity of the external valuation experts engaged by management\n- For selected property valuation reports: Assessment of the applied methods, assessment of the reasonableness of the underlying assumptions and estimates (eg. rental income, discount/capitalization rate, usable space, vacancy rate) by means of comparison with market data as well as comparison whether the fair values as per property valuation reports are withing our own developed range of fair values\n- Check of certain input-data as included in the property valuation reports with data in the accounting system or underlying agreements\n- Assessment of the adequacy and completeness of the disclosures made in the financial statements by the management\n\n#### Other matter\n\nThe financial statements of IMMOFINANZ AG for the year ended December 31, 2022, were audited by another auditor who expressed an unmodified opinion on those statements on March 24, 2023.\n\n#### Other Information\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report and the annual financial report, but does not include the financial statements, the management report and the auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, to consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n#### Responsibilities of Management and of the Audit Committee for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, for them to present a true and fair view of the assets, the financial position and the financial performance of the Company and for such internal controls as management determines are necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n{287}------------------------------------------------\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.\n\n#### Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the EU regulation and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISA, always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the EU regulation and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISA, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.\n\nWe also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure \n\n{288}------------------------------------------------\n\nabout the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n#### Comments on the Management Report\n\nPursuant to Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, the management report is to be audited as to whether it is consistent with the financial statements and as to whether the management report was prepared in accordance with the applicable legal regulations.\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the management report in accordance with Austrian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing for the audit of the management report.\n\n#### Opinion\n\nIn our opinion, the management report for the Company was prepared in accordance with the valid legal requirements, comprising the details in accordance with Section 243a Austrian Company Code UGB, and is consistent with the financial statements.\n\n#### Statement\n\nBased on the findings during the audit of the financial statements and due to the thus obtained understanding concerning the Company and its circumstances no material misstatements in the management report came to our attention.\n\n{289}------------------------------------------------\n\n## Additional information in accordance with Article 10 EU regulation\n\nWe were elected as auditor by the ordinary general meeting at May 3, 2023. We were appointed by the Supervisory Board on July 14, 2023. We are auditors since the financial year 2023.\n\nWe confirm that the audit opinion in the Section \"Report on the financial statements\" is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee referred to in Article 11 of the EU regulation.\n\nWe declare that no prohibited non-audit services (article 5 par. 1 of the EU regulation) were provided by us and that we remained independent of the audited company in conducting the audit.\n\n## Responsible Austrian Certified Public Accountant\n\nThe engagement partner is Alexander Wlasto, Certified Public Accountant.\n\nErnst & Young Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft m.b.H.\n\nAlexander Wlasto mp Isabelle Vollmer mp\n\nIsabelle Vollmer mp\n\nWirtschaftsprüfer / Certified Public Accountant\n\nWirtschaftsprüfer / Certified Public Accountant Wirtschaftsprüferin / Certified Public Accountant\n\nThis report is a translation of the original report in German, which is solely valid.
