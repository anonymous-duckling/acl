He is looking at the laptop screen and typing on the keyboard. The pipes and valves are various shades of blue and gray, and they are connected to a large blue tank in the background. The man has a beard and short dark hair. He is wearing a white shirt under his suit jacket.\n\n## **6.5 Recognition of our impact solutions**\n\nWe take action every day to limit our impact, but we also offer our customers solutions to help them reduce their ecological footprint. These solutions have been praised by experts for their effectiveness and added value for customers.\n\nThree LACROIX solutions stood out in this respect in 2023:\n\n- Prio V2X, a solution designed to ease the flow of public transport traffic and contribute to the decarbonisation of cities through implementation of an ecosystem geared to smart vehicles, was chosen from a selection of 100 solutions to accelerate the ecological transition presented to the European Commission in June.\n- AIRoads, a project conducted in collaboration with start-up WaltR, which aims to reconcile mobility and air quality, was also selected from this selection of 100 solutions and was awarded the prize for Sustainable Artificial Intelligence at the WAICF 2023 (World AI Cannes Forum)\n- Finally, Aquawize, our AI-based software solution, is a decision-making tool that automatically analyses and detects problems in water supply networks at an early stage. It was also selected as one of the 100 solutions for accelerating the ecological transition.\n\n#### In addition, Aquawize\n\n• won the Innovative Solution Award, a prestigious prize for the most innovative and sustainable solutions in the water sector by Water Europe (an initiative launched by the European Commission to improve coordination and collaboration in the water sector and contribute to solving global challenges through research and innovation).\n\n- won the Alliancy trophy for meaningful digital technology in the Environmental Impact category.\n- won the Tech4Green Award in the French-speaking Village at CES Las Vegas 2023\n\n• won the Planinium Future Digital Awards for Smart Cities & IoT Innovation 2023 from Juniper Research (a consultancy specialising in long-term forecasting and digital technology markets) in the Most Innovative Urban Sustainability Project category.\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **ELIGIBILITY AND ALIGNMENT WITH THE EUROPEAN TAXONOMY**\n\nThe EU Green Taxonomy is a system for classifying economic activities to identify those that are environmentally sustainable.\n\nIn accordance with Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of June 2020, supplemented by Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 of June 2021 and Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486 of June 2023 of the European Commission, LACROIX has analysed the eligibility and alignment of its activities in financial year 2023 with the **European Taxonomy**.\n\nGiven the complexity of our supply chain, with tens of thousands of electronic component references, it is currently very difficult for LACROIX to guarantee its compliance with the **Do No Significant Harm (DNSH)** principle (according to which, in order to be considered aligned, economic activities must not cause significant harm to other environmental objectives defined by the European Taxonomy), as well as with **minimum social guarantees (Minimum Social Safeguards).**\n\nWe could have considered that compliance with the regulations in the countries where we operate, as well as the contractual obligation of our suppliers to do likewise, were sufficient to ensure that our activities meet these two sustainability criteria (DNSH and MSS), but on the advice of an external consultancy, we preferred to adopt a **conservative approach**. Accordingly, although the majority of LACROIX's eligible activities meet the technical criteria of the European Taxonomy, we now consider that LACROIX's activities are not aligned with the sustainability criteria of the European Taxonomy. We reserve the right to change our position in the coming years, depending on further due diligence done in the future.\n\n#### **REVENUE IN 2023 ELIGIBILITY AND ALIGNMENT OF LACROIX ACTIVITIES WITH THE EUROPEAN TAXONOMY**\n\n| Sales as a proportion of total revenue |                                    |     |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----|\n| Aligned with the taxonomy by objective | Eligible for taxonomy by objective |     |\n| Climate Change Mitigation (CCM)        | 0%                                 | 31% |\n| Climate Change Adaptation (CCA)        | 0%                                 | 26% |\n| Water and Marine Resources (WTR)       | Not required                       | 7%  |\n| Circular Economy (CE)                  | Not required                       | 91% |\n| Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) | Not required                       | 0%  |\n| Biodiversity and ecosystems (BIO)      | Not required                       | 0%  |\n\nThe new regulatory tables required by the taxonomy (see below) offer greater granularity and transparency. They allow us to specify which category of each of the six environmental objectives (see \"Code\" column) our different products are eligible for (see Economic activities column) and to indicate which environmental objective they contribute most to (category in bold in the Code column).\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                                                                                                              |                              |               | Substantial contribution criteria       |                                   |                                   |           |               |                         |                   |  |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------|---------------|-------------------------|-------------------|--|\n| Economic activities (1)                                                                                                      | Code (a) (2)                 | Revenue (3)   | Proportion<br>of revenue,<br>year N (4) | Climate change<br>mitigation (5)  | Adapting to climate<br>change (6) | Water (7) | Pollution (8) | Circular<br>economy (9) | Biodiversity (10) |  |\n| A.2 Activities eligible under the taxonomy but not environmentally sustainable<br>(not aligned with the taxonomy) (g)        |                              |               |                                         |                                   |                                   |           |               |                         |                   |  |\n| Environment Activity                                                                                                         |                              |               |                                         |                                   |                                   |           |               |                         |                   |  |\n| SOFREL                                                                                                                       |                              |               |                                         |                                   |                                   |           |               |                         |                   |  |\n| HVAC : remote management<br>of facilities                                                                                    | CCM 3.5 -

This methodological guide for internal Group use sets out the definitions and methodologies to be applied in order to ensure the consistency of consolidated information.\n\nThis CSR report has been reviewed by the independent third-party body EY.\n\nWith regard to the scope covered:\n\n- The workforce indicators cover 100% of the scope. The social and societal indicators do not include companies with fewer than 20 employees, and some do not include our workforce in Mexico (in which case this is specified in the text).\n- The environmental indicators cover industrial and semi-industrial sites with more than 50 employees, representing 95% of the group's consolidated turnover and 95% of the workforce. Industrial and semiindustrial sites with fewer than 50 employees, as well as office sites, are excluded from the reporting scope because their environmental impacts are negligible compared to the Group's industrial sites, and because several data sets are not available for these sites (in particular waste monitoring data).\n\nGiven the nature of our activities, we consider that the following themes: actions to promote the link between the Nation and the Army and to support commitment to the reserves, the fight against food waste, the fight against food insecurity, respect for animal welfare and responsible, fair and sustainable food do not constitute the main CSR risks and do not warrant a development in this report. As far as physical and sports activities are concerned, their promotion is left to the discretion of each site.\n\nThe Group has not implemented any practices aimed at artificially reducing its corporation tax or moving its taxable income to tax havens.\n\nLACROIX monitors tax contributions made by organisations by country of location.\n\nTransfer pricing documentation is monitored and updated on a regular basis and is subject to audits and inspections.\n\nIn this respect, LACROIX is not at risk of attempting tax evasion.\n\nThe reporting period corresponds to the fiscal year, i.e. from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023. The stated comparative basis therefore refers to the period running from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022, i.e. the equivalent period for the previous fiscal year.\n\nAfter you have read the reports submitted by your Statutory Auditors, the Board asks you to adopt the resolutions on which you are required to vote.\n\n> Drawn up in Saint-Herblain, on 26 March 2023 The Board of Directors\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **FIVE-YEAR FINANCIAL SUMMARY AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT AREAS**\n\n| Nature of items                                                                                           | 2017/2018  | 2018 / 2019 | 2019 / 2020 | 2021       | 2022       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|------------|\n| CAPITAL AT YEAR END                                                                                       |            |             |             |            |            |\n| - Share capital                                                                                           | 25 000 000 | 25 000 000  | 25 000 000  | 32 055 239 | 32 055 239 |\n| - Number of existing ordinary shares                                                                      | 3 766 560  | 3 766 560   | 3 766 560   | 4 829 096  | 4 829 096  |\n| - Number of preference shares (non-voting)                                                                |            |             |             |            |            |\n| - Maximum number of future shares to be created                                                           |            |             |             |            |            |\n| TRANSACTIONS AND REVENUE FROM THE FINANCIAL YEAR                                                          |            |             |             |            |            |\n| - Revenue net of taxes                                                                                    | 4 155 210  | 6 098 794   | 9 944 480   | 10 274 844 | 13 172 772 |\n| - Pre-tax profit, employee profit-sharing, depreciation,<br>allowances and provisions                     | 4 040 601  | 3 652 372   | 173 477     | 4 679 451  | 11 396 919 |\n| - Income taxes                                                                                            | -3 575 140 | -4 619 761  | - 5 919 185 | -3 969 767 | 3 598 451  |\n| - Employee profit-sharing payable for the year                                                            | 0          | 0           | 0           | 0          | 0          |\n| - Profit after tax, employee profit-sharing, depreciation,<br>allowances and provisions                   | 7 193 223  | 8 578 017   | 6 091 533   | 8 640 922  | 14 518 488 |\n| - Distributed profit                                                                                      | 2 711 923  | 3 389 904   | 2 561 261   | 4 104 732  | 3 863 277  |\n| EARNINGS PER SHARE                                                                                        |            |             |             |            |            |\n| - Profit after tax, employee profit-sharing, before<br>depreciation, allowances and provisions            | 2,02       | 2,20        | 1,62        | 1,79       | 1,61       |\n| - Profit after tax, employee profit-sharing, depreciation,<br>allowances and provisions                   | 1,91       | 2,28        | 1,62        | 1,79       | 3,01       |\n| - Dividend per share                                                                                      | 0,72       | 0,90        | 0,68        | 0,85       | 0,80       |\n| PERSONNEL                                                                                                 |            |             |             |            |            |\n| - Average number of employees during the year                                                             | 12         | 27          | 27          | 27         | 64         |\n| - Total payroll for the year                                                                              | 1 633 085  | 2 592 440   | 4 588 082   | 4 889 575  | 4 850 541  |\n| - Total amount paid for employee benefits in the year<br>(social security, company welfare schemes, etc.) | 784 637    | 1 411 738   | 2 407 622   | 2 272 238  | 2 172 581  |\n\nDrawn up in Saint-Herblain,\n\non 26 March 2022\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY'S REPORT ON CONSOLIDATED NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENT**\n\n#### **LACROIX Group**\n\nYear ended the 12 31, 2023\n\n*This is a free translation into English of the original report issued in the French language and it is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking users. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France.*\n\nTo the General Assembly,\n\nIn our quality as an independent third party, accredited by the COFRAC (Accreditation COFRAC Inspection, n° 3-1681, scope of accreditation available on the website www.cofrac.fr), and as a member of the network of one of the statutory auditors of your Lacroix Group (hereinafter \"Lacroix Group\"), we conducted our work in order to provide a conclusion expressing a limited assurance on the compliance of the consolidated non-financial statement for the year ended 12 31, 2023 (hereinafter the «Statement») with the provisions of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and on the fairness of the historical information (whether observed or extrapolated) provided pursuant to 3° of I and II of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code (hereinafter the «Information») prepared in accordance with the Lacroix Group's procedures (hereinafter the «Guidelines»), included in the management report pursuant to the requirements of articles L. 225 102-1, R. 225-105 and R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).\n\n#### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed as described under the \"Nature and scope of procedures\" and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that cause us to believe that the consolidated non-financial statement is not prepared in accordance with the applicable regulatory provisions and that the Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines, in all material respects.\n\n#### **Preparation of the non-financial performance statement**\n\nThe absence of a commonly used generally accepted reporting framework or a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure the Information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques that can affect comparability between entities and over time.\n\nConsequently, the Information needs to be read and understood together with the Guidelines, summarised in the Statement or, on request from the LACROIX Group's management\n\n#### **Limitations inherent in the preparation of the Information**\n\nThe information may be subject to uncertainty inherent in the state of scientific or economic knowledge and the quality of external data used. Some information is sensitive to the choice of methodology and the assumptions or estimates used for its preparation and presented in the Statement.\n\n#### **Responsibility of the LACROIX Group**\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Management to:\n\n- select or establish appropriate criteria for the preparation of the Information;\n- prepare a Statement pursuant to legal and regulatory provisions, including a presentation of the business model, a description of the main non-financial risks, a presentation of the policies implemented considering those risks as well as the outcomes of said policies, including key performance indicators and, the information set-out in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (green taxonomy);\n- prepare the Statement by applying the LACROIX Group's \"Guidelines\" as referred above; and to\n- implement the internal control procedures it deems necessary to ensure that the Information is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe Statement has been endorsed by the Board of Directors.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Responsibility of the independent third party**\n\nBased on our work, our responsibility is to provide a report expressing a limited assurance conclusion on:\n\n- the compliance of the Statement with the requirements of article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code;\n- the fairness of the information provided pursuant to part 3 of sections I and II of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code, i.e. the outcomes of policies, including key performance indicators, and measures relating to the main risks.\n\nAs we are engaged to form an independent conclusion on the Information as prepared by management, we are not permitted to be involved in the preparation of the Information as doing so may compromise our independence.\n\nIt is not our responsibility to report on:\n\n- the Lacroix Group's compliance with other applicable legal and regulatory requirements, in particular the information set-out in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (green taxonomy), the French duty of care law and anti-corruption and tax avoidance legislation.\n- the fairness of the information set-out in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (green taxonomy)\n- the compliance of products and services with the applicable regulations.\n\n#### **Applicable regulatory provisions and professional guidance**\n\nWe performed the work described below in accordance with Articles A. 225-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes) applicable to such engagement, in particular the professional guidance issued by the Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes, Intervention du commissaire aux comptes – Intervention de l'OTI – Déclaration de performance extra-financière, our own procedures (Programme de verification de la déclaration de performance extra-financière, July 7th 2023) acting as the verification programme and with the international standard ISAE 3000 (revised).\n\n#### **Independence and quality control**\n\nOur independence is defined by the provisions of Article L. 823-10 of the French Commercial Code and French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors\n\n(Code de déontologie) of our profession. In addition, we have implemented a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures aimed at ensuring compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, ethical requirements and the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes) relating to this engagement.\n\n#### **Means and resources**\n\nOur verification work mobilized the skills of three people and took place between January 2024 and February 2024 on a total duration of intervention of about four weeks.\n\nWe were assisted in our work by our specialists in sustainable development and corporate social responsibility. We conducted three interviews with the people responsible for preparing the Statement, representing in particular risk management, compliance, human resources, and environmental departments.\n\n#### **Nature and scope of the work**\n\nWe are required to plan and perform our work to address the areas where we have identified that a material misstatement of the Information is likely to arise.\n\nThe procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment. In carrying out our limited assurance engagement on the Information:\n\n- we obtained an understanding of all the consolidated entities' activities and the description of the main risks associated;\n- we assessed the suitability of the criteria of the Guidelines with respect to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and understandability, with due consideration of industry best practices, where appropriate;\n- we verified that the Statement includes each category of social and environmental information set out in Article L. 225 102 1 III of the French Commercial Code as well as information regarding compliance with human rights and anti-corruption and tax avoidance legislation and includes, where applicable, an explanation of the reasons for the absence of the information required under Article L. 225- 102-1 III, paragraph 2 of the French Commercial Code;\n- we verified that the Statement provides the information required under Article R.225-105 II of the French Commercial Code where relevant with respect to the main risks;\n\n*(1) ISAE 3000 (révisé) Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information*\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\n- we verified that the Statement presents the business model and a description of the main risks associated with all the consolidated entities' activities, including where relevant and proportionate, the risks associated with its their business relationships, its their products or services, as well as their policies, measures and the outcomes thereof, including key performance indicators associated to the main risks;\n- we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to\n\n• assess the process used to identify and confirm the main risks as well as the consistency of the outcomes, including the key performance indicators used, with respect to the main risks and the policies presented, and\n\n• corroborate the qualitative information (measures and outcomes) that we considered to be the most important presented in Appendix 1; concerning certain risks (eco design, impact products, ethics and compliance), our work was carried out on the consolidating Lacroix Group, for the others risks, our work was carried out on the consolidating Lacroix Group and on a selection of entities : Lacroix Baupréau, Lacroix Zriba\n\n• we verified that the Statement covers the scope of consolidation, i.e. all the consolidated entities in accordance with article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code within the limitations set out in the Statement;\n\n- we obtained an understanding of internal control and risk management procedures the Lacroix Group has implemented and assessed the data collection process aimed at ensuring the completeness and fairness of the Information;\n- for the key performance indicators and other quantitative outcomes that we considered to be the most important presented in Appendix 1, we implemented:\n\n• analytical procedures to verify the proper consolidation of the data collected and the consistency of any changes in those data;\n\n• tests of details, using sampling techniques, in order to verify the proper application of the definitions and procedures and reconcile the data with the supporting documents. This work was carried out on a selection of contributing entities and covers between 20% and 34% of the consolidated data relating to the key performance indicators and outcomes selected for these tests (34% of energy consumption, 20% of headcount);\n\n• we assessed the overall consistency of the Statement in relation to our knowledge of all the consolidated entities.\n\nThe procedures performed in a basis for our limited assurance conclusion review are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance opinion in accordance with the professional guidelines of the French National Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes); a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures.\n\nParis-La Défense, the 26 March 2024 French original signed by:\n\n#### **Independent third party EY & Associés**\n\nChristophe Schmeitzky Partner, Sustainable Development\n\n*La CNCC considère que la traduction n'est pas signée, dans la mesure où il s'agit d'une traduction libre en anglais du rapport original établi en français.

LACROIX GROUP**\n\nLACROIX is an international industrial and technological mid-cap business whose mission is to enable customers to build and run smarter life ecosystems thanks to connected technologies that are relevant, robust, and secure. Our ambition is to become a world leader in Industrial IoT and electronic devices for critical applications.\n\nAs a listed family business, we are able to combine the agility necessary to innovate in a constantly changing technological world with the long-term vision to invest in and build the future. We provide safe, connected equipment for the management and coordination of critical infrastructure such as intelligent road (street lighting, traffic management, road signs, and V2X) and water and energy facilities (smart grids and heating networks). We design, industrialise, and produce electronic equipment for our automotive, industry, home automation, aeronautics, and healthcare customers.\n\nEvery day, we work within our ecosystems alongside our customers and partners to create the link between the world of today and the world of tomorrow. We help them to build the industry of the future and to make the most of the opportunities for innovation that are all around us. We supply them with equipment and solutions for a smarter world.\n\n### **Consolidated income**\n\nOver the period, the company's business evolved as follows:\n\n- At 31 December 2023, revenue of €761.2M, with harmonious growth in our businesses (Electronics +7.6%, City +6.7%, Environment +8.1%);\n- Current EBITDA of €41.6M, with an improvement in City, Environment and Elec EMEA, but overall performance penalised by ELEC North America;\n- Operating profit of €3.8M impacted by significant non-recurring items: - €10M exceptional amortisation of the Customer List as a result of evolving OMC on the customer base of LACROIX Electronics MI (formerly Firstronics),\n\n- the consequences of the planned disposal of the Signalisation BU (sale of the building and treatment as an asset held for sale on the closing balance sheet),\n\n- The impact of the cyber attack (mainly the cost of rebuilding operational systems), which led to the temporary closure of 3 of our plants in May 2023 before a gradual restart;\n\n- An increase in financial expenses due to the fullyear impact of higher interest rates;\n- Net profit (Group share) was €4.3M, with the decline limited by the capitalisation of deferred tax on profitable entities and the recognition of minority interests;\n\nSignificantly positive free cash flow of €23.2M, benefiting in particular from an initial improvement in working capital requirements.\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Major events by activity**\n\n#### **Electronics Activity**\n\n#### **Connected technologies for smarter industries**\n\nOn the road to the industry of the future, this activity develops, industrialises, produces and integrates electronic assemblies and sub-assemblies for the automotive, aeronautics, home automation, industrial and health sectors. It assists its customers in creating innovations and developing the world of \"Smart Industries\".\n\nRepresenting more than 74% of revenue and more than 83% of the Group's workforce, this activity has enjoyed recurring and sustained growth over the last 10 years, enabling it to triple its sales during this period. The market, growing globally but also in Europe, also benefits from the 'nearshoring' trend. This trend towards relocation closer to the end markets is also supported by growing environmental concerns.\n\nIn this context, the major events of financial year 2023 were as follows:\n\n- Continued business growth (+7.6%), driven by the EMEA region and with a positive contribution from North America, albeit at a slower pace than anticipated.\n- Contrasting market segment dynamics, with strong automotive growth in Europe in the first half, followed by a slowdown in H2, a declining HBAS market throughout the period after years of strong growth post COVID, and strong growth in the industrial and aerospace segments, driven respectively by the introduction of new customers and the turnaround in the aerospace market after difficult years post COVID. In North America, the second half of the year was disrupted by strikes at US car-makers and by the ramp-up of new programmes, which took longer than expected.\n- •A gradual return to normal in the components markets (even if certain families may remain under pressure), with the impact of a reduction in one-off re-invoicing of excess supply costs, and also the gradual reduction in inventory levels.\n- Current EBITDA fell by 27% from €26.9M to €19.6M, with very different contributions from each geographical region. In EMEA, EBITDA has benefited from higher sales, reduced pressure on the components market and improved operating efficiency, leading to a significant improvement in EBITDA (+20%). Conversely, performance in North America was impacted by increases in payroll costs (inflation and appreciation of the Mexican peso), industrial disorganisation which penalised performance and operational control, leading to significant inventory discrepancies at the end of the period.\n- Current operating income of €1.9M, compared with €10.0M.\n- Net income fell sharply, with an exceptional write-off of USD 10M on the Firstronics Customer List, and higher financial expenses due to the full-year impact of rising interest rates.\n- A positive FCF, with better control of working capital requirements and the start of a reduction in inventories in line with the gradual normalisation of the components market.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of more uncertain end-market dynamics (automotive, HBAS), business is likely to mark a pause in the sustained growth of recent years, although the programmes won should continue to fuel growth at certain sites. Current operating profitability should also rise, thanks in particular to the vigorous action plan implemented to turn performance around in North America.\n\nThe key figures for the Electronics Activity are as follows (contribution):\n\n| In €M                    | N<br>(12 months) | N - 1<br>(12 months) |\n|--------------------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| Revenue                  | 562.1            | 522.2                |\n| Current EBITDA           | 19.6             | 26.9                 |\n| Current operating profit | 1.9              | 10.0                 |\n| Net income               | (17.4)           | (0.2)                |\n| Cash flow                | 7.7              | 14.7                 |\n| Investments*             | xxx              | 15.9                 |\n\n(\\*) Net investments excluding investments relating to M&A operations.\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Environment Activity**\n\n#### **Connected technologies for smarter water & energies**\n\nThe scarcity of water and energy resources is one of the biggest global concerns. Optimising their use is a priority and controlling the impact of human activities on the environment is a fundamental need for any company with a committed CSR policy. By designing and producing equipment to control, automate and remotely manage water and energy infrastructures, LACROIX Environment has chosen \"Smart Water & Energy\", at a time of digital revolution and connected objects, to optimise the use of water and energy resources.\n\nExperiencing constant growth (its sales have doubled in under 10 years), and with the acquisition of SAE IT-systems, which has an equivalent offer in electricity networks, this activity accounts for 11% of Group revenue and contributes significantly to profits.\n\nEvolving in buoyant markets worldwide, with the challenges and the maturity of the water and energy markets creating a context that favours smart, connected equipment, the Environment Activity pursues investments in HR and Research & Development (R&D) to accelerate its international development, where it currently achieves around 25% of its sales.\n\nIn this context, the major events of the financial year were as follows:\n\n- Another year of dynamic growth in revenue (+8.1% in 2023 after +9.1% in 2022) to €82.6M, with the Water France, Water International and Smart Grids segments all contributing to this performance, and with a steady HVAC segment).\n- Accelerating international development in target areas, notably Saudi Arabia, where the company achieved revenue in excess of €3.0M in 2023, benefiting from investments aimed at improving the efficiency of water management services.\n- Current EBITDA of €17.9M, confirming the target of over 20%\n- COI remaining at high levels at €16.3M, despite continued investments in R&D (expensed) and HR to support and reinforce growth.\n\nThe activity's outlook is favourable, with momentum remaining positive. Results will remain excellent.\n\nThe key figures for the Environment Activity are as follows (contribution):\n\n| In €M                    | N<br>(12 months) | N - 1<br>(12 months) |\n|--------------------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| Revenue                  | 82.6             | 76.4                 |\n| Current EBITDA           | 17.9             | 16.5                 |\n| Current operating profit | 16.3             | 14.9                 |\n| Net income               | 11.9             | 9.9                  |\n| Cash flow                | 12.7             | 10.8                 |\n| Investments*             | xx               | 1.1                  |\n\n(\\*) Net investments excluding investments relating to M&A operations.\n\n### **City Activity**\n\n#### **Connected technologies for smarter mobility**\n\nBy designing and producing equipment for the management of intelligent road infrastructures based on four areas of expertise: road signs, traffic management and regulation, street lighting and V2X, LACROIX City directs, enhances and secures the flows of traffic and people, demonstrating its commitment to \"Smart Mobility\".\n\nLACROIX City addresses this market, which it knows well, and promotes its transformation through the adoption and mastery of technologies. For decades, LACROIX City has been meeting the needs of a changing world that is becoming more and more urban and connected, while supporting communities and businesses with equipment used for smart roads. Its expertise and experience provide a solid foundation for imagining and designing tomorrow's connected technologies.\n\nThe major events of the 2023 financial year were as follows:\n\n- Revenue up to €116.4M, from €109.1M in 2022, with growth across all segments.\n- Continued strong growth in the public lighting segment (+15%), driven by the structurally favourable winds of smart public lighting and supported by the performance of contracts signed internationally, notably in Flanders.\n- Signalisation and Traffic activities recovering to +6.9% and 3.6% vs. -9% and -8%, with a favourable effect from the performance of contracts in Morocco for Traffic and a favourable effect from price revisions in the Signalisation segment. For the record, price increases are passed on through the application of price adjustment formulas, which are applied on the anniversary date.\n- Recurring EBITDA up sharply to €4.3M (vs. +€0.9M in 2022), also an improvement on 2021 (€1.0M). This upward trend was driven in particular by price adjustments in a context of raw material prices returning to more normal levels over the period\n- An improvement in current operating income to a profit of €0.9M, compared with a loss of €2.5M in 2022.\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\n• Net income of €1.8M, impacted by items relating to the ongoing disposal of the Signalisation segment (net capital gain on the disposal of the building, capital loss arising from its treatment as an asset held for sale at 31 December).\n\nThe City business should see the sale of the Signalisation segment completed during the next financial year. On a like-for-like basis (excluding Signalisation), business should continue to grow. Margins will be impacted from time to time by the end of the absorption of structural costs by the Signalisation segment.\n\nThe key figures for the City Activity are as follows (contribution):\n\n| In €M                    | N<br>(12 months) | N - 1<br>(12 months) |\n|--------------------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| Revenue                  | 116.4            | 109.1                |\n| Current EBITDA           | 4.3              | 0.9                  |\n| Current operating profit | 0.9              | (2.5)                |\n| Net income               | (1.8)            | (4.3)                |\n| Cash flow                | 1.2              | (1.9)                |\n| Investments*             | xx               | 1.5                  |\n\n(\\*) Net investments excluding investments relating to M&A operations and financial assets.\n\n## **Research & Development Activity**\n\nR&D activities concern all activities and are recognised as operating expenses. In 2023, these activities generated €3.6M of Research Tax Credit (CIR) in the 2023 accounts.\n\nFor the record, in 2021 LACROIX was selected to take part in 3 collaborative and innovative projects, two of which are winners of the \"relocation in critical sectors\" tender, under the France Relance (Relaunching France) plan. For the period 2021- 2024, the projects in question address themes such as urban mobility and its impact on air quality, or better management of critical resources such as water. These projects give rise to the recognition of operating subsidies (partial financing of R&D work).\n\n### **Financial situation**\n\nCFFO (cash flows from operations) totalled €34.1M compared to €33.0M in the previous year.\n\nOver the period, the change in working capital requirements made a positive contribution (+€8.9M) despite the dynamic growth in revenue, confirming the start of the expected improvement after two years of deterioration due to pressure on supplies in the components market.\n\nCapital expenditure (excluding financial expenses) was contained at €16.9M (2.2% of revenue). In addition, LACROIX completed asset disposals totalling €3.7M, primarily the disposal of the Signalisation BU's main building.\n\nAs a result, Free Cash Flow was positive at +€23.2M compared to -16.9 €M\n\nIn addition, the following special features should be noted:\n\n- Treatment as an asset available for sale led to the deconsolidation of a debt of around €5M\n- New borrowings totalling €33.9M, including €10M for an 8-year recovery participating loan (PPR) with a 4-year grace period\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group's net debt (excluding rent and acquisition debt) totalled €112.9M compared with €138.8M. Positive cash flow amounted to €42.5M on the closing date. The ratio of net debts (excluding debts for rentals and acquisitions) to equity (gearing) amounts to 0.59 compared to 0.72 as at 31 December 2022.\n\n#### **Prospects**\n\nFollowing a year marked by solid business growth and resilient profitability, LACROIX expects 2024 to be a year of contrasts depending on its markets.\n\nTaking into account the economic uncertainties of 2024, LACROIX expects sales excluding signage to exceed €710 million in 2024, slightly up on its 2023 level excluding signage (i.e. €702 million). The recurring EBITDA margin is expected to exceed its 2023 level, within a range of 5.5% to 6.5%.\n\nBy 2025, the Group confirms its sales target of €800 million, conditional on the completion of an external growth operation and more favorable demand trends in the automotive and HBAS markets. An EBITDA margin of around 9% remains the target, but realistically this seems difficult to achieve as early as 2025. Nevertheless, LACROIX remains fully confident in its ability to reach this new milestone in the medium term.\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **LACROIX Group**\n\n### **Company activity**\n\nAs the parent company of the Group, it is responsible for the management of assets, mainly comprising the equity of the parent companies of the three activities and some subsidiaries, and supervises and coordinates each of them through General Management and Executive Management, as well as Finance, Legal & Compliance, Human Resources, Strategic Innovation, R&D, IT, and Communication Departments.\n\nLACROIX Group also shares a certain number of resources between activities, such as the teams in the Payroll shared-service centre, the managers of cross-cutting projects (IT, Finance, HR, etc.), and the central R&D teams working on the common platforms of our future offers.\n\nRevenue, excluding dividends, is generated by royalties received from subsidiaries in exchange for the services described above.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, revenue totalled €13,291K, compared with €13,173K in the prior period, reflecting the stability of the scope of services provided for Group companies.\n\nOperating income fell to -€1,835K compared to -€934K. This change is due in particular to the base effect, which involved the vacancy of certain posts leading to a one-off reduction in operating expenses.\n\nThis loss was largely offset by the positive net financial income of +€14,996K compared with +€11,911K, and the income tax benefit of €4,056K compared with €3,598K relating to the integrated profits system.\n\nAs such, net income was €17,206K compared to €14,518K for the previous financial year.\n\n#### **Non tax-deductible expenses**\n\nNon tax-deductible expenses and charges at the end of the year amounted to a total of €40,826.\n\nThis amount corresponds to the non-deductible portion of the lease payments on the cars used by the Company for an amount of €32,890 and to corporate vehicle tax (TVS) charges of €7,936, which generated a tax charge of 10,207 euros.\n\n### **Information on payment terms**\n\nIn accordance with Articles L. 441-6-1 and D. 441-4 of the French Commercial Code, we hereby inform you that at the end of the

MAIN RISK FACTORS FACED BY THE COMPANY**\n\nUnder the provisions of Article L. 225-100-1, I 3 of the French Commercial Code, we present the relevant information:\n\n### **Strategic and operational risks**\n\nThe nature of the strategic risks to which the Company is exposed is unlikely to seriously jeopardise the sustainability of Group activities.\n\nIn view of its activities, the Group is nevertheless exposed to the following operational risks:\n\n#### **Risks relating to raw materials and shortage of electronic components**\n\nRaw materials account for a large proportion of the purchases made by the Group, and a significant share of its revenue. They account for over 70% of revenue, and raw materials account for over 85% of its purchases. This is particularly true in the Electronics Activity, where purchases account for close to 70% of revenue. The Group is exposed both to their price fluctuations and their availability on the market. Any sustained increase in purchase prices and/or variability in the availability of inputs could jeopardise the economic balance of the contracts and harm the Group's business by increasing its costs and reducing its profitability\n\nThe Group's contracts generally include price indexing mechanisms linked to changes in the cost of inputs. This is the case, notably, for the City Activity, which has price review clauses in its multi-annual contracts with local authorities. This is also mainly the case for the Electronics Activity, where some component prices are even under customer control, enabling both upward and downward price changes to be passed on. These mechanisms do not always cover all costs, as sometimes there is a time lag between the rise in input prices and the rise being passed on to the selling price, but they do help greatly mitigate the impact.\n\nTo better mitigate such impacts, the Group may also be led to hedge certain raw materials (aluminium, tin, etc.) with suppliers or on the markets.\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **IT system risk**\n\nGroup Management pays particular attention to its IT system and a series of provisions has been implemented to ensure its security and availability. This involves regularly updating the Group's solutions, its technical architecture, and its security architecture. The regular completion of audits and intrusion tests, carried out by third-party experts, contributes to this continuous improvement. Furthermore, in order to reduce any major risks, crisis management plans have been implemented in each of the 3 business sectors and have been audited over the year.\n\n#### **Risks relating to matching the Group's offer to the expectations of its customers, and to the development of new products**\n\nThe Group's growth relies partly on its ability to integrate new technologies into its products in order to offer optimal performance to its customers in line with their practices. More broadly, it is essential for the Company to anticipate the needs and practices of its customers in order to develop the products and technologies appropriate to their requirements. In this context, the Group devotes a significant proportion of its expenditure and staff to its research and development activity in order to develop new products, services and technologies existing products, and where necessary improve existing ones. The quality and success of the Group's research and development are key to its commercial success.\n\nIn order to limit this risk in a context of accelerating R&D expenditure, LACROIX has i) strengthened its innovation capacity by creating the LACROIX Lab, teams in charge of experimenting with uses and technologies, in contact with the Group's customers in order to monitor and anticipate changing needs; ii) created the key account management function in order to strengthen proximity with strategic customers; iii) strengthened the marketing teams throughout the 2016-2020 plan, thus enabling better market monitoring and, above all, better definition/ specification of customer needs; iv) strengthened the R&D teams for better control of technologies and the implementation schedule in our new offerings (the right product at the right time), and; v) set up a process between the marketing and R&D teams to ensure consistency between market needs and development choices/priorities.\n\n#### **Industrial and environmental risks**\n\nThe significant scale of the Company's industrial investment programmes ensures that it has recent and secure equipment to mitigate the risks of major failures that might bring manufacturing operations to a halt. Therefore, the main industrial risks are those that could affect or stop production at the main sites (fire, technical breakdown, etc.) and compromise the quality of products. Quality procedures are in place for identifying, correcting, and preventing, or at least mitigating, failures.\n\n#### **Legal, tax, and social risks**\n\nThe Group monitors legal, tax, and social developments in order to ensure that its operations are compliant, and to anticipate the impacts of new regulations. A review of the main risks is performed per business sector in order to ensure that all risks are exhaustively considered in the financial statements.\n\nBased on known information, the Group considers it unlikely that current mutual agreement procedures or disputes will have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n### **Financial risks**\n\nThe different degrees to which the Group is exposed to financial risks are set out below.\n\n#### **Currency risk**\n\nOther than the Electronics Activity, the Group is not exposed to currency risks.\n\nIn the Electronics business, the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk, mainly with regard to component purchases, which are often made in USD or JPY, as well as other payroll costs and/or service purchases invoiced in TND, MXN and PLN.\n\nAs regards purchases in USD and JPY, the Company has contracts with its main customers enabling it to adjust the selling price of products according to changes in the EUR/USD exchange rate. Therefore, the currency risk for this item is under control. For the balance, the Company uses partial hedging of its needs to cover a target rate set each fiscal year. Purchases in USD and JPY represent approximately €90 million annually, 80% of which is passed on to customers through contracts. For the remaining part, exchange rate hedging is carried out to secure a \"budget\" rate.\n\nExpenditure in TND, MXN and PLN (around €70 million) mainly concerns salaries and social charges for employees at the Tunisian, Mexican and Polish sites, and some local purchases. The Group's policy is to carry out forward hedging on the basis of forecast requirements, enabling a \"budget\" rate to be covered (one-year horizon). Changes in labour costs are also factored into the new commercial offers.\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\nGenerally speaking, the use of financial instruments is limited strictly to business requirements, and excludes any speculative activities.\n\n#### **Interest rate risk**\n\nA significant proportion of the Group's debt is at variable rates.\n\nThe Group implements various financial instruments of varying maturities to mitigate this risk. At the end of December 2022, the portion of financing at variable rates hedged by swaps was 29% of the nominal value.\n\n#### **Liquidity risk**\n\nGross debt position for the Group amounts to €163,048K.\n\nAvailable cash amounts to €22,613K. The Group therefore considers its exposure to this risk to be low.\n\n#### **Counterparty risk**\n\nCounterparty risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group in the event that a customer defaults on its contractual obligations.\n\nCustomer profiles by sector of activity are described below:\n\n| Activities             | Types of<br>main clients                                                                   |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| LACROIX<br>City        | Authorities and private<br>companies operating road<br>infrastructures                     |\n| LACROIX<br>Environment | Public bodies and major<br>water, heating and energy<br>network management<br>stakeholders |\n| LACROIX<br>Electronics | French and foreign<br>companies operating<br>internationally                               |\n\nThus, customer typology itself is a limiting factor in this risk.\n\nIn addition, each of the Group's activities has implemented a system for monitoring and managing customer risk, sometimes using credit insurance contracts for this purpose to protect from potential customer risk.\n\n## **POST-CLOSING EVENTS**\n\nIn its annual sales press release dated 9 February 2023, LACROIX announced its intention to divest its Road Signs segment (8% of LACROIX' turnover) in order to focus its investments on its strategic markets around industrial IoT and electronic equipment. This historic segment holds a leading position in road signs, particularly in France where it has a 25% market share, enjoying a very strong reputation among local authorities and road operators.\n\nHowever, in view of the evolution of the markets addressed, the technological and commercial synergies between the Road Signs segment and the two other market segments addressed by LACROIX's City activity, Street Lighting and Traffic Management, are too limited.\n\nParticular attention will be paid to the industrial and social plans of the potential buyers of this business segment, so that it can benefit from the resources it needs for its continued development.\n\nThe scope of the proposed sale represents revenue of €55 million and involves 315 employees through the Saint-Herblain industrial site (260 people), three distribution subsidiaries (Reunion, Mayotte and New Caledonia), and a facility in Spain.\n\n## **STOCK MARKET INFORMATION**\n\n## **Changes in share price over the 2023 financial year**\n\nThe LACROIX Group share is listed on Euronext Paris (compartment B).\n\nOver the course of financial year 2023, 706,784 shares were traded for a capital amount of €22,657,759 at an average price of €32.23.\n\nThe share price as at closing on 31 December 2023 was €29.50.\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Company purchases of treasury shares**\n\n#### **Share buy-back programme**\n\nOur proposition is to renew the powers given by the General Meeting on 11 May 2023 to the Board of Directors to purchase Company shares on the stock market, under the conditions and within the limits specified in Articles L. 22-10-62 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, and pursuant to the provisions of European Regulation no. 2273/2003 of 22 December 2003.\n\nThe aims of the buy-back programme are identical to those for the previous financial year:\n\n- to ensure market-making under a liquidity contract compliant with AFEI's code of ethics recognised by the Financial Markets Authority,\n- to purchase shares for retention and subsequent allocation for trade or payment as part of an external growth operation,\n- to ensure coverage of plans to allocate bonus shares or share purchase options, and more generally all shareholding plans for employees and corporate officers of the Group,\n- to enable cancellation of all or part of the shares bought back.\n\nAuthorisation is granted for a maximum term of 18 months subject to the following conditions:\n\n- the maximum number of redeemable shares may not exceed 335,016, i.e. 6.94% of share capital.\n- the maximum purchase price per share is set at €60.\n- the total amount earmarked for this programme is set at €20,102,520.\n\nThe shares will be bought back through trading on the market or through block share acquisitions as per the applicable laws and regulations. Block share acquisitions could account for the entire programme. Acquisitions and disposals can be made during a public offering within the limits permitted by stock market regulations.\n\nThe number of shares held under execution of the scheme may not exceed 10% of share capital, i.e. 482,909 shares.\n\n#### **Assessment of previous share buy-back programmes**\n\nUnder the programmes authorised by the General Meetings of 11 May 2021 and 6 May 2022, applying to the financial year ending 31 December 2023, the Company made the following transactions in its own shares: sale of 2,091 shares to cover bonus share allotment plans or stock option plans and, more generally, all shareholding plans for the Group's employees and officers.\n\nIn addition, under the liquidity agreement held 100% by LACROIX Group:\n\n- 12,813 shares were acquired at an average price of €32.43;\n- 12,612 shares were sold at an average price of €32.72.\n\nAt the end of the financial year, the shares held under the buy-back programme were allocated to the following objectives:\n\n- coverage of stock option plans for employees and corporate officers of LACROIX Group: 61,470 shares,\n- subsequent allocation for trade or payment as part of an external growth operation: 80,334 shares,\n- stabilisation of the price by a service provider: 4,199 shares,\n\ni.e. a total of 146,003 treasury shares representing 3.02% of the capital, having a book value of €2,812,060 and a market value of €4,350,889 based on the price on 31 December 2023.\n\n## **REGULATED AGREEMENTS**\n\n### **New agreements**\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Article L. 225-38 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, any agreement entered into directly or through an intermediary between the Company and its Chief Executive Officer, one of its Deputy Chief Executive Officers, one of its directors, one of its shareholders holding more than 10% of the voting rights or, in the case of a shareholder company, the company controlling it as defined by Article L. 233-3 of the said code, is subject to prior authorisation by the Board of Directors and is the subject of a special report by the auditor with a view to ratification by the General Meeting: In 2022, the following new agreement was concluded:\n\n### **Loan agreement with LACROIX North America**\n\nPersons concerned: Nicolas Bedouin (Chief Operating Officer of LACROIX Group and Chair of LACROIX North America on the date of signing of the agreement).\n\nNature and purpose: Conclusion of a loan agreement between the Company and LACROIX North America, dated 8 June 2023.\n\nAmount: The amount of the loan is USD 5,277,463, with an interest rate of 8%.\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Previous agreements that continued during the year**\n\nIn accordance with legal requirements, the Board of Directors examined the previous agreements that were still in force:\n\n#### **Provision of services agreement with VINILA INVESTISSEMENTS**\n\nPersons concerned: Vincent Bedouin (Chair & CEO of LACROIX Group and Chair of VINILA INVESTISSEMENTS), Nicolas Bedouin (Chief Operating Officer of LACROIX Group and member of the Supervisory Board of VINILA INVESTISSEMENTS), and Marie-Reine Bedouin (member of the Board of Directors of LACROIX Group and Chair of the Supervisory Board of VINILA INVESTISSEMENTS).\n\nNature and purpose: Conclusion of a provision of services agreement on 4 January 2021, ratified by the general meeting of 6 May 2022, whereby VINILA INVESTISSEMENTS undertakes to make available to the Company premises situated at 5 rue de la Pérouse, 75016 Paris, France.\n\nAmount: The amount of the annual flat compensation paid in return for the provision of service comes to €20,000 excl.

With regard to the adoption of the principles set out in the Middlenext Code, the Board of Directors has taken due note of the \"points to be watched\" mentioned therein, has considered the issues arising from them and has confirmed that the Company is committed to respecting each of these points. This management report also details below the Company's compliance with the recommendations of the Middlenext Code, and where applicable explains the reasons why some of them could not be implemented at the date of this management report.\n\nAccordingly, in accordance with Article L.22-10-10-4 of the French Commercial Code, the Company mentions below the recommendations that have been rejected and the reasons why they were rejected:\n\n- R1 members of the Board of Directors attend the General Assembly: Since minority shareholders hardly ever attend general meetings, the mandatory attendance of directors is not justified.\n- R2 entrusting services other than certifying financial statements to a firm other than the auditor's: as the value of such services remains low in relation to their volume of business, with reasonable service amounts, the independence of the auditors is not called into question.\n- R5 three-year training plan for directors: The board of directors is constituted on the basis of their past training and experience, which they continue to acquire during their term of office. The implementation of a training plan must provide real added value, and will therefore be the subject of further reflection.\n- R7 the chairmanship of the specialised committees is entrusted to independent members, except in very special cases for which reasons are given: Vincent Bedouin, as Chair and CEO of the Group, is best placed to chair the strategic committee.\n- R9 and R17 putting in place a succession plan for the leader and key people: This point requires further reflection before it is formalised.\n- R11 staggered renewals of terms of office for Board members: Staggered renewals of terms of office are no longer in place since the switch to the one-tier mode. A reflection on this point will be undertaken on the arrival of a new director.\n\n### **Composition and operation of the administrative and management bodies**\n\n#### **Composition and operation of the Board of Directors**\n\nThe Board of Directors is the collegiate body that determines the Company's policies and ensures their implementation, defines the Company's strategy, appoints the corporate officers and, through its deliberations, regulates any questions concerning the proper running of the Company in accordance with the powers conferred by the law, the Articles of Association, and the Board of Directors' internal regulations.\n\nThe Board of Directors is composed of at least three (3) members and at most eighteen (18) members, to which the representatives of the named employees may be added.\n\nThe number of directors over the age of 70 cannot exceed one third of the Board of Directors in office.\n\nThe term of office for each director is three (3) years.\n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\n| On 31 December 2023, the Board of Directors of LACROIX Group comprised 7 members: |

Board of Directors**\n\nTaking into account the criteria recommended by the Middlenext Code for qualifying a director as independent, it appears from the examination of the situation of each director that Mr Hugues Meili, Ms Ariane Malbat, Mrs Muriel Barneoud and Mr Pierre Tier all meet the conditions for qualifying as independent.\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Representativeness of women on the Board of Directors**\n\nIn accordance with Articles L. 225-18-1 and L. 22-10- 3 of the French Commercial Code on the balanced representation of women and men on Boards of Directors and on professional equality, we hereby inform you that the male/female distribution within the Company's Board of Directors is 57% to 43% as of 31 December 2023.\n\nThere are 3 female members out of a total of 7 members currently on the Board of Directors.\n\n#### **Mission of the Chair of the Board of Directors**\n\nThe Chair of the Board of Directors organises and directs the work of the Board of Directors, which he reports to the General Meeting of shareholders of the Company.\n\nThe Chair of the Board of Directors ensures the proper functioning of the Company's corporate bodies, including the committees under the Board of Directors.\n\n#### **Information for directors**\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors have received all the documents and information they need to carry out their duties within the time needed for their examination.\n\nThe Chair has regularly provided the directors with all relevant information concerning the Company.\n\n#### **Rules of procedure of the Board of Directors**\n\nOn 26 July 2018, the Board of Directors adopted the rules of procedure allowing it to meet by videoconference or telecommunications, and updated them on 16 December 2019, 19 September 2022 and 20 March 2023.\n\nThese rules also define the Board of Directors' operating rules regarding ethics (share ownership, non-disclosure, conflict of interest, etc.).\n\n#### **Work of the Board of Directors**\n\nThe Board of Directors meets as often as the interests of the Company require. The work is organised through committees.\n\nDuring the year ending 31 December 2023, the following 11 meetings were held:\n\n- Four meetings of the Board of Directors, with an attendance rate of 92,86%, in order to:\n\t- Consider the annual and half-year financial statements,\n\t\t- Set up a CSR committee.\n- Two meetings of the Audit and Compliance Committee\n- Two meetings of the Development Committee\n- Two meetings of the Compensation Committee\n- Three meetings of the CSR Committee\n- A meeting of the strategic committee\n\n#### **Specialised committees of the Board of Directors**\n\nThe Board of Directors has established 5 permanent Committees:\n\n- an audit & compliance committee\n- a compensation committee\n- a strategic committee\n- a development committee\n- a CSR committee\n\nThe mission of which is to provide in-depth analysis and reflection prior to the Board of Directors' deliberations and to contribute to the preparation of the Board's decisions.\n\n## **Audit & Compliance Committee**\n\nThe audit & compliance committee, acting under the responsibility of the Board of Directors, is primarily responsible for reviewing the accounts and monitoring issues relating to the preparation and control of accounting and financial information. It also oversees the definition and monitoring of the Company's compliance programme. It follows the process of preparing financial information and, where appropriate, makes recommendations to ensure its integrity.\n\nAs such, it is responsible for:\n\n- following the process of preparing financial information;\n- monitoring the effectiveness of the internal audit and risk management systems, and the effectiveness of the compliance programme;\n- issuing recommendations on the Statutory Auditors proposed at the General Meeting;\n- monitoring the Statutory Auditors' performance of their tasks;\n- monitoring the Statutory Auditors' compliance with the conditions of independence;\n- approving services other than account certification (SACC);\n- reporting to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Audit & Compliance Committee must inform the Board of Directors immediately of any difficulties encountered. These reports are either inserted in the minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors concerned, or attached as an appendix to these minutes.\n\nThe Audit & Compliance Committee is composed

Directors sign an annual declaration attesting that they had no conflicts of interest during the past financial year.

The Board of Directors may also carry out any investigation in the event of reasonable doubt, and may if necessary call in an independent expert.\n\n#### **Main features of internal control and risk management procedures**\n\nThis report on the internal control and risk management procedures implemented within LACROIX Group is based on the implementation guide for the reference framework published by the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority) and applicable to mid-cap and small-cap stocks of financial markets. The objectives of internal control at LACROIX Group can be achieved thanks to the environment created within the Group, as well as the specific organisation put in place, from which specific internal audits and risk management procedures stem. All of these points are presented below.\n\n#### **Internal control objectives and stakeholders**\n\nInternal control, as it is deployed within LACROIX Group, contributes to the prevention and control of risks arising from the Company's business, including risks relating to errors and fraud. In particular, it ensures:\n\n- Compliance with applicable laws and regulations;\n- Reliability of financial statements;\n- Safeguarding and protection of assets;\n- Prevention and management of risks, and the implementation of process optimisations.\n\nLike any monitoring system, the internal control system cannot provide an absolute guarantee that all the risks of error and fraud are totally eliminated.\n\nNaturally, these objectives can only be achieved through appropriation and application of the rules and procedures by all the Company's staff, under the supervision of each head of department. LACROIX Group centralises the management of its internal control, supported by the **Legal & Compliance** department for some aspects and the **Audit & Internal control** department for others.  \n\nThe Audit & Compliance Committee aims monitors and challenges the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management system.\n\n#### **Internal control environment**\n\nA number of structural standards for internal control exist within LACROIX Group.   \n\nOur **Values** - audacity, commitment, team spirit, openness, and respect – are therefore points of reference that unite our internal teams. They guide conduct, encourage initiatives, and give responsibility in a positive way. In addition, the **Ethical Charter** sets out the ethical principles applicable at LACROIX Group for conducting business and individual behaviour. It does not claim to address all questions of an ethical nature, but rather sets out the basic rules and guidelines that must govern each decision. It provides the framework for the **Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct** and the **Competitiveness Code of Conduct**: these compliance programmes contribute to employee awareness and training, and make it possible to implement appropriate mechanisms for the prevention of offences, and their detection and punishment where appropriate.\n\nThe **Opportunities & Threats Matrix** is based on the strategic plan, and its priorities are reviewed by the Executive Committee every year. This matrix identifies subjects having the greatest impact and the most important levers for sustainable growth at LACROIX Group. This matrix is part of the multi-year development plan defined by the Management.\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, the **Operating Rules** between LACROIX Group and each of the activities define the levels of responsibility borne by the various players, as well as their areas of responsibility. These rules are supported by **delegations of authority**, enabling responsibility to be devolved to those with specific skills, authority, and the necessary means.\n\n#### **Organisation of internal control**\n\nInternal control is everyone's responsibility. In particular, all process leaders are responsible for ensuring the existence and application of procedures within their scope and for ensuring the associated regulatory monitoring. Nevertheless, an organisation as well as control, monitoring and steering tools exist, giving Management the keys to decision-making on the one hand, and ensuring handover of internal control at all levels within LACROIX Group on the other. The main factors are described below:\n\n- **• The Management Controller Managers** of activities oversee reports to General Management. In particular, they allow monthly monitoring of budget commitments by subsidiary, by segment or both, and also include non-financial elements and forecasts, ensuring better management of subsidiaries.\n- Likewise, **cash reporting** centralised at the head office ensures weekly monitoring of cash flows and the debt position of subsidiaries and consolidated debt.\n- **• The chief accountants** are responsible for the reliability of financial reporting, and more particularly for due observance of the Group's procedures. The tax returns of the LACROIX Group's French subsidiaries are prepared or checked by the central Accounting Department. These tax returns are also regularly reviewed by external consultants.\n- **• The consolidation department** is centralised at headquarters. It prepares the accounts in accordance with IFRS and ensures the consistency of processing operations and their compliance with Group rules and procedures.\n- **• The Legal & Compliance Department** ensures overall regulatory compliance (company law, contracts, insurance, compliance, etc.) and supports activities in the context of major contractual negotiations or litigation management. It advises the General Management and intervenes in internal restructuring and external growth operations. Advice can be obtained from outside experts on an ad hoc basis. **Compliance advisers** are in place within each of the activities. They act as relays for the Legal & Compliance Department, working alongside the teams to communicate rules and procedures, and are easily available to answer any ethical questions asked by staff.\n\n**• The Information System Department** notably ensures the integrity and safeguarding of data, as well as the security and availability of our IT systems. As such, external intrusion audits and IT disaster recovery tests are regularly conducted under the supervision of the IT Department and the CISO (Chief IT Security Officer). All the LACROIX Group's major subsidiaries use **ERP**software.\n\n#### **Implementation of internal control**\n\nThe Audit & Internal control department plans its duties on the basis of approved priorities in the Opportunities & Threats Matrix. It also relies on the recommendations of our statutory auditors on internal control and IT configuration. From this perspective, its duties revolve around:\n\n- Monitoring compliance with the law and with internal rules;\n- Improving operational processes;\n- Continuous improvement of internal control and the fight against fraud;\n- Support provided to the Legal & Compliance Department.\n\n#### **Main activities in financial year 2023**\n\nFor the 2023 fiscal year, the following tasks were carried out:\n\n• Continuous improvement of internal control and the fight against fraud: • Deployment of the automated control solution on the Electronics activity of the LACROIX group,\n\n• Updating Opportunities & Threats Matrix and redefining priorities,\n\n• Continuation of campaigns for awareness raising and combating external fraud,\n\n• Review of the segregation of duties implemented in our ERP software,\n\n• Continuous securing of our information systems.\n\n• Internal auditing of subsidiaries: • 14 subsidiaries were audited on key procedures: the various cycles are reviewed to ensure proper application of accounting rules and methods, thereby ensuring the reliability of financial reporting. Several compliance issues are\n\nalso included in these audits. - Follow-up of action plans further to previous audits for 7 subsidiaries in 2023.\n\n• Operational audits:\n\n• Monitoring proper replenishment of strategic stocks,\n\n• Checking the correct application of our marketing/R&D process on new products.\n\n• Support provided to the Compliance Department: • Our mapping of corruption risks was updated\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Areas of focus for 2024**\n\nThe areas of focus defined for 2024 will mainly concern:\n\n- Continuous improvement of internal control and the fight against fraud:\n\t- Deployment of additional automated controls\n\t- on the Electronics activity of the LACROIX group, • Continuation of campaigns for awareness\n\t- raising and combating external fraud, • Review of the segregation of duties\n\t- implemented in our ERP software,\n\t- Continuous securing of our information systems,\n\t- Monitoring the proper implementation of business continuity plans in our main subsidiaries.\n- Internal auditing of subsidiaries:\n\t- 15 subsidiaries are to be audited during the year,\n\n• From 2024, the action plans will be monitored every six months to ensure that all the recommendations made by the Internal Audit Department are implemented.\n\n#### • Operational audits:\n\n• Level-3 controls on the entire SAPIN 2 anticorruption system;\n\n- Audit of the Cyber risk management system. • Internal audit intervention during an annual physical inventory to identify possible\n- improvements in its preparation\n- Support provided to the Compliance Department • Updating corruption scenarios and associated security action plans.\n\n#### **Factors likely to have an impact in the event of a takeover**\n\nFactors likely to have an impact in the event of a takeover are disclosed in the Management Report.\n\n#### **Shareholder attendance at the General Meeting**\n\nSpecial arrangements concerning shareholder attendance at the General Meeting are described in Articles 22 and 23 of the Company's Articles of Association. Additionally, some of these conditions, together with practical information, are contained in the meeting notices and invitations published and/or sent to shareholders before each meeting.\n\n#### **Diversity and equity policy within the company**\n\nThe Group is committed to achieving gender balance and equity at all hierarchical levels. The policy and related achievements are described in the Non-Financial Performance Statement.\n\n## **COMPANY**\n\n## **ADMINISTRATION AND CONTROL**\n\nAs all the directorships of the members of the Board of Directors expire at this General Meeting, it is proposed that the General Meeting:\n\n- Renew the directorships of:\n\t- Mrs Murielle Barneoud\n\t- Mr Vincent Bedouin\n\t- Mr Hubert de Boisredon\n\t- Mr Ariane Malbat\n\t- Mr Hugues Meili\n\t- Mr Pierre Tiers\n- Appoint Mrs Christine Lioret as director, replacing Mrs Marie-Reine Bedouin, whose term of office is not renewed, for a term of three (3) years expiring at the end of the Ordinary General Meeting of shareholders to be held in 2027 to approve the financial statements for the year then ended.\n\nThe engagements of the Statutory Auditors have not expired.\n\n## **APPROPRIATION OF**\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **PROFIT**\n\nWe suggest that you approve the appropriation of the financial year's net profit of €17,089,706.60, plus retained earnings of €1,519,389.35, as follows:\n\n| Profit from the financial year                             | 17,089,706.60 euros |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Plus retained earnings                                     | 1,519,389.35 euros  |\n| Making a distributable profit of                           | 18,609,095.95 euros |\n| As dividends to shareholders<br>Namely €0.80 per share     | 3,863,276.80 euros  |\n| To the \"Other reserves\" account<br>which thus totals €95M. | 11,000,000.00 euros |\n| The balance in \"Retained earnings\"                         | 1,401,462.15 euros  |\n\nOn the understanding that this amount shall be increased by the fraction of the dividends corresponding to shares held by the Company as part of its share buy-back programme.\n\nFollowing this appropriation, shareholders' equity stands at €171,428,205.17 before the portion of dividends on the treasury shares held by the Company.\n\nSince 1 January 2018, a single flat tax of 30% is deducted from distributed profit (12.8% as income tax and 17.2% as social security contributions),\n\n\\* individuals in a tax household for which the reference taxable income of the year before last was less than €50,000 (single, divorced or widowed taxpayers) or €75,000 (joint taxpayers) may apply for exemption from payment of 12.8% income tax; shareholders are responsible for making this request for exemption by no later than 30 November of the year preceding payment of the dividend,\n\n\\* the progressive dividend taxation option is still possible and must be stated on the tax return; in this case, the 12.8% flat tax will be deducted from the tax due.

In a world where energy and resources are increasingly scarce and precious, the technologies we retain and develop must demonstrate both their usefulness and their sobriety.\n\nLACROIX is an international technological and industrial group. We want to continue to grow it, but not at any price: we want to design and manufacture electronic equipment and industrial IoT solutions that contribute to the ecological transition.\n\nAnd because words are not enough, we have set ourselves a target with a date and a figure: to reach 80% of impact products in our sales by 2030, compared with 61% in 2022.\n\nThis means foregoing certain markets if they are contrary to our conception of useful technology. But above all it means concentrating our energy and resources on electronic solutions that help build the world of tomorrow: low-carbon mobility, intermodal transport, management of water, heating and electricity networks, technical management of buildings, low-energy and efficient industry, etc.\n\nWe are convinced that these will be the most buoyant markets in the long term... and they already are.\n\n### **2024, here we come!**\n\nIn 2024, we will be stepping up our efforts to meet our 4 commitments: develop our activities that have a positive impact, design eco-efficient solutions, conduct our operations in a sustainable manner and to make a commitment to our teams and our territories:\n\n- Deploying the Impact Score, our impact assessment tool, for each commercial opportunity\n- Constructing the Group's low-carbon trajectory as part of the ACT Step-by-step approach, and setting greenhouse gas emission reduction targets based on the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)\n- Finalising the Ecodesign by LACROIX approach, to ensure that 100% of our new products are eco-designed\n- Deploying a Quality of Life at Work roadmap on each site, in line with the Great Place to Work survey, and roll-out of the Women at Lacroix programme, which aims to improve the representation of women in managerial and expert positions.\n\nThe Executive Committee and I are more determined than ever and convinced that positive impact will generate the most profitable and sustainable growth for LACROIX.\n\n> **Vincent Bedouin**  *Chair*\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **LACROIX values**\n\nBy aligning social and operational rules with these values, LACROIX's teams help to place people at the centre of the organisation. LACROIX managers and their staff thus avail of a reference framework understood by all and invaluable for taking action, coordinating their interactions, and guiding their decision making.\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/3 description: The image shows a line drawing of a rocket ship taking off. Below the rocket ship is a dark blue rectangle with the word \"BOLDNESS\" in white letters.\n\n\"Whether or not you think you can do it, you should always try.\"\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/5 description: The image shows a graphic with two circles, each containing a simple outline of a person. Curved arrows connect the two circles, indicating a cyclical relationship or exchange.

Below the icon is a dark blue rectangle with the word \"RESPECT\" written in white, bold letters.\n\n\"We're a team because we respect each other, trust each other, and care about each other.\"\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/9 description: The image shows a graphic of three people represented by simple line drawings of heads and shoulders. The figures are arranged in a triangular formation, suggesting a group or team. Below the graphic is a dark blue rectangle with the words \"TEAM SPIRIT\" in white, uppercase letters.\n\n**OPEN-MINDEDNESS**\n\n\"If you want to go fast, set off alone. If you want to go far, set off together!\" \"Strength comes from differences, not similarities.\"\n\n## **LACROIX confirms its commitment via external guidelines**\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/14 description: The image shows the logo for Gaia Rating. The logo consists of a circle in blue, with the words \"Gaia\" in blue and \"RATING\" in orange inside the circle.\n\nLACROIX has been preparing for an annual diagnostic and benchmarking exercise since 2018, including the extra-financial procedure conducted by Gaïa Rating. In 2023 (during the 2022 financial year), LACROIX received an ESG score of 63/100 compared to 61/100 in 2022.\n\nImage /page/43/Figure/16 description: The image is a silver Ecovadis Sustainability Rating badge for 2023. The badge is circular with a silver border. The word \"SILVER\" is written in silver on a silver ribbon at the top of the badge. The word \"ecovadis\" is written in green in the center of the badge. Below that, the words \"Sustainability Rating\" are written in black.\n\nIn 2023, LACROIX responded to the Ecovadis assessment questionnaire, which assesses the performance of companies in terms of environment, working conditions, ethics and responsible purchasing. LACROIX obtained a score of 61/100, higher than or equal to 79% of companies rated by Ecovadis and a significant increase compared with 2022 (53/100).\n\nImage /page/43/Figure/18 description: The image is a red square with a white logo and text. The logo is a stylized plus sign with a square in the center, and the text \"CDP\" is to the right of the logo. Below the logo and text is the word \"DISCLOSER\" in a smaller font, and below that is the number \"2023\" in a large font.\n\nIn 2023, for the first time, LACROIX answered the questionnaire of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the international reference body for assessing the climate strategy of organisations. For this first reporting year, we obtained a score of C- Awareness, the average for companies in the electronics sector. We are confident that the actions we are currently putting in place (see section 6.3 on our greenhouse gas emissions) will enable us improve this score in 2024.\n\nFurthermore, LACROIX's strategy and actions are in line with the Sustainable Development Goals, the 10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact and the 8 fundamental conventions of the ILO.\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Our positive impact strategy**\n\nIn December 2023, LACROIX published its positive impact strategy and 2030 impact objectives.\n\nImage /page/44/Picture/3 description: The image shows four cards with text and images related to sustainability.

The \"R\" in a circle is located at the bottom right corner of the square.\n\nTo understand the expectations of its employees and their relationship with work and the company, and to measure their support for its projects, in 2023 for the first time, LACROIX conducted on all its sites the Great Place to Work satisfaction survey, a global benchmark in this respect. This survey replaces the LACROIX & You internal survey, which was also conducted among all Group employees.\n\nIn 2023, 83% of employees took part in the Great Place to Work survey. The results provide a rich source of information for improvement initiatives.\n\nFollowing this initial survey, 5 LACROIX sites have already been quality-certified as a Great Place to Work in 2023. The next Great Place to Work satisfaction survey will be conducted on all the Group's sites in 2024.\n\n## **1.3 Organisation of corporate dialogue**\n\nLACROIX is committed to establishing high-quality social dialogue with staff representation bodies.\n\nThis dialogue takes the form of work meetings and discussions with staff representation bodies, whose configuration varies according to local legislation. These exchanges are intended to create a responsible and constructive relationship of trust, conducive to business development and employee fulfilment within the Group.\n\nThe Group particularly welcomes the quality of exchanges that took place in relation to the health crisis, which made it possible to introduce measures seeking to protect the health of employees.\n\nWhenever required by law, LACROIX entities have staff representation bodies, which held more than 171 meetings in 2023 across the entire Group (148 in 2022 and 180 in 2021). The Electronics business also holds its European Social and Economic Committee meeting.\n\n## **1.4 Health and safety at work**\n\nLACROIX has a duty and responsibility to protect the health and safety of its employees, and endeavours to assess and improve working conditions and implement accident prevention measures in collaboration with the bodies representing its employees and external stakeholders.\n\n#### **Health, safety, and dedicated training programmes**\n\nAccident prevention and safety are organised through dialogue with various representatives: Social & Economic Committee (CSE), Health & Safety and Working Conditions Committee (CHSCT) or similar organisations on international sites (CCE, etc.). The various health and safety bodies operating within LACROIX cover almost 100% of staff. In a spirit of collaboration and responsibility, those involved ensure LACROIX's compliance with local obligations and regulations and work to roll out training initiatives of a regulatory or preventative nature.\n\n#### **Accidents at work**\n\nThe frequency rate of accidents at work was 6.0 in 2023, compared with 5.6 in 2022 and 6.9 in 2021. The main accidents at work still relate to handling operations. There are regular reminders of safety instructions and good practice in movements and postures.\n\nThe accident severity rate fell by 0.03 points in 2023. The results justify the steps taken to prevent accidents, monitor compliance with security measures, raise awareness around the risks involved in our activities, and ensure that personal protective equipment is worn. These measures are designed for the long term, enabling a steady reduction in the severity rate since 2021, with a drop of 0.08 points between 2021 and 2023.\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### ANNUAL REPORT 2023\n\nOccupational hazard awareness training for new staff in workshops is systematically included as part of their induction process. Regular communication campaigns provide reminders of the guidelines and the importance of this matter, and managers are directly involved in supporting workplace safety approaches.\n\nImage /page/53/Figure/2 description: The image contains a bar chart and a text box. The bar chart shows the frequency rate and severity rate from 2021 to 2023. In 2021, the frequency rate is 6.9 and the severity rate is 0.17. In 2022, the frequency rate is 5.6 and the severity rate is 0.12. In 2023, the frequency rate is 6.0 and the severity rate is 0.09. The text box is titled \"GOOD PRACTICES\" and contains the following text: \"For each accident leading to work stoppage, a diagnostic procedure is implemented with root cause analysis and action plans.\"\n\n(1) Number of workplace accidents with at least 1 day of stoppage \\*1,000,000 / effective work hours. (2) Number of days' stoppage due to workplace accidents \\* 1,000 / effective work hours.\n\nLACROIX makes regular investments intended to improve the working environment of its employees, helping to enhance both safety and comfort.\n\nSome of the most significant examples of this are as follows:\n\n- Acquisition of electric pallet trucks with levellers to avoid handling heavy loads\n- Installation of safety systems for double rack storage at height\n- Installation of smoke extractors at exposed workstations\n- Investments in automatic storage systems to limit handling operations and enhance their safety.\n- Securing circulation areas in workshops\n\n#### **Absenteeism**\n\nAfter two years (2021 and 2022) marked by a high number of absences due to Covid-19, and absenteeism rates of around 8.6%, the absenteeism rate fell sharply to 5.51% in 2023.\n\nShort-term sick leave fell by 1.58%, accounting for most of the absenteeism rate.\n\n|                                          | 2023  | 2022  |\n|------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Short-term illness                       | 3.70% | 5.28% |\n| Occupational illness                     | 0.03% | 0.05% |\n| Workplace and commuting accidents        | 0.04% | 0.10% |\n| Maternity, paternity, and adoption leave | 1.74% | 3.18% |\n| Total absenteeism rate                   | 5.51% | 8.63% |\n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Accident prevention and health-related awareness-raising measures**\n\nIn several of the group's entities, prevention measures have been taken to raise awareness among employees of actions that improve their daily work.\n\nLACROIX also provides training courses and exercises required by regulations in all the countries where it operates.\n\nFor instance, its employees are regularly trained or retrained in the use of handling equipment (operator licenses), first-aid (first-responder courses), fire emergencies (front and rear fire-warden training), risks related to the use of hazardous products and chemicals, and the use of high-voltage currents (certification and training).\n\nImage /page/54/Picture/5 description: A person wearing a white lab coat and a virtual reality headset is standing in a room. The person is holding a thin object in their hands and appears to be interacting with the virtual environment. The room has a green wall and a plant in a pot in the background.\n\nA first for the Kwidzyn site in Poland, which in 2023 used an augmented virtual reality device for first-aid training.\n\nThanks to this scheme, 40 employees were given practical first aid and evacuation training.\n\nImage /page/54/Picture/8 description: In a classroom setting, a group of seven individuals, mostly women, are gathered around a black mat on the floor. At the center of the mat is a light brown object, possibly a training dummy or model. Most of the individuals are wearing white lab coats, suggesting a medical or scientific context. One person is wearing a pink shirt. They are all looking down at the object on the mat, possibly observing or participating in a demonstration. The background includes chairs, a table, and a screen with some text or images on it, further indicating an educational or training environment.\n\nFor example, in 2022 the HSE department at the Kwidzyn site in Poland organised a first-aid course. Topics included how to use a defibrillator, how to put an injured person in a lateral position, first aid in case of injury, first aid kit equipment, how to transport injured people using a chair. A total of 130 people were trained.\n\nImage /page/54/Picture/10 description: This image is a promotional poster for mammography screenings. The poster is pink and features the text \"Badania Mammograficzne\" at the top. There are three images of a mobile mammography unit, which is a white van with the letters \"NZF\" on the side. There is also a circular logo with the words \"Support Cancer Awareness\" and a pink ribbon.\n\nIn 2023, the Kwidzyn site in Poland, the Beaupreau site in France and the Zriba site in Tunisia will all be raising awareness of the risk of breast cancer.\n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **2. TALENTS AND SKILLS**\n\nIn a rapidly changing technological environment where digital services and data management are ever-more essential, developing skills and retaining talent are key factors for success, identified as major challenges in LACROIX's materiality assessment.\n\n## **2.1 Gender equality**\n\nImage /page/55/Picture/4 description: The image shows the number of women and men. The number of women is 2,702 and the number of men is 2,396. The symbol for women is on the left and the symbol for men is on the right.\n\n**Women account for 53% of the group's workforce in 2023** (an increase of one point compared to 2022 when women made up 55% of the workforce).\n\nThey account for **58% of the Electronics Activity's staff**, which employs a predominantly female workforce in its workshops.\n\nLACROIX closely monitors the equal treatment of men and women in the workplace. Each activity takes account of wage gaps that may exist between men and women, seeking to reduce any such gaps.\n\nIn addition to Company-level agreements and mandatory action plans, specific measures are in place to make it easier for women to carry out a professional activity.\n\nIn 2023, the gender equality index will be above 75 points for most of the Group's companies based in France, for which this indicator must be calculated (companies with more than 50 employees). Companies with an index below 75 points have drawn up an action plan to improve the index through targeted measures.\n\nImage /page/55/Picture/10 description: The image is a circular logo for \"Women at Lacroix\". The logo consists of a large, stylized letter \"W\" in a dark blue color, centered within a circle. The words \"WOMEN AT LACROIX\" are arranged around the circumference of the circle, also in dark blue. The text is evenly spaced and follows the curve of the circle, creating a border around the central \"W\".\n\nIn 2023, LACROIX committed to improving the representation of women in technical professions, particularly in management and expertise, through an internal \"Women at LACROIX\" programme. The initiative proposes various actions to be implemented to promote our professions to schoolchildren and offer training, such as the fight against everyday sexism and unconscious bias. It also involves participating in a number of targeted partnerships: Elles Bougent, StOpE, IndustriElles.\n\nImage /page/55/Picture/12 description: The image shows the logo for \"Industrielles\". The word \"Industrielles\" is written in blue, with the \"E\" in \"Industrielles\" stylized with three horizontal lines. To the right of the word is a blue circle with two vertical white lines inside.\n\n*IndustriElles* is a programme run by the Ministry of Industry to mobilise men and women in industry to actively promote gender diversity in the industrial sector. In 2023, we signed our commitment to contribute to the initiative by implementing the various recommendations proposed.\n\nElles bougent\n\n*Elles bougent* is a widely-recognised association whose aim is to increase gender diversity in companies in the industrial and technological sectors. The association's activities help raise awareness of the industrial and technical professions among schoolchildren and young female students. It is also a programme of mentors who help young people choose and follow our career paths. LACOIX has been a member of the association since 2023.\n\nImage /page/55/Picture/16 description: The image shows the logo for Technovation Girls France. The word \"TECHNOVATION\" is in blue, with a green leaf-like design to the left. Below that, \"Girls France\" is written in green and blue.\n\nIn 2023, we informed our employees of the option of registering their daughters aged between 13 and 17 to take part in the Technovation Girls France association, which supports young girls with mentoring and sessions to help them build an entrepreneurial project around technology.\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **2.2 Training**\n\nStaff training is a key priority, contributing to employee upskilling and individual fulfilment of potential. It is important for the effective involvement of everyone within the Group, and drives collective success.\n\nEach LACROIX activity defines its annual training plan, taking into account the development areas The group's strategies, the needs expressed by managers and the wishes expressed by employees.\n\nThe Group set aside 74,591 hours of training for its teams in 2023, compared with 50,385 hours in 2022. Sustained training efforts. The educational budget allocated to training was stable in 2023 at €734K, compared with €732K in 2022. Figures from the Juarez site in Mexico are consolidated in the reported figures, which was not the case in 2022.\n\nThis training covers support for developing new business-specific expertise and processes, introducing new business tools and software, further digitalisation of tools, and taking on new responsibilities.\n\nAcross LACROIX activities, training initiatives break down as follows:\n\n|                   | ELECTRONICS        |                | CITY               |                | ENVIRONMENT        |                |\n|-------------------|--------------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------|\n|                   | Number of<br>hours | Budget<br>(€K) | Number of<br>hours | Budget<br>(€K) | Number of<br>hours | Budget<br>(€K) |\n| Training provided | 65,907             | 397            | 5,480              | 218            | 2,984              | 106            |\n\n220 hours of training were also provided in relation to LACROIX Corp. activities, for a budget of €13K.\n\n#### **GOOD PRACTICES**\n\nLACROIX has introduce a training course leading to a diploma, aimed at developing a managerial, environmental and leadership culture.\n\n**LACROIX Corporate Executive Program for senior executives**\n\nThe classes include trainees with international profiles and trainees from business lines representative of the Group.\n\nAll share a common foundation built on the Group's vision, values, and management principles.\n\n13 managers graduated on the 2022-2023 LACROIX Corporate Executive programme, successfully completing the programme launched in October 2023.\n\nImage /page/56/Picture/15 description: The image shows a presentation in front of an audience.

The total number of women is 2702, and the total number of men is 2396.\n\n### **Workforce breakdown by age bracket**\n\nThe workforce is characterised by young and predominantly female staff.\n\nIn 2022, 53% of the LACROIX workforce were under 40 (56% in 2022), and 8% over 55 (7% in 2022).\n\n#### **Geographical breakdown**\n\nThe story of LACROIX began in France. The development of the Group's activities over recent years has seen it support customers and conquer new markets internationally.\n\nThis international development has naturally been accompanied by changes in the geographical distribution of its workforce. As a result of the acquisition of Firstronics in North America 75% of the workforce is located outside France in 2023, compared with 77% in 2022.\n\n| LACROIX has bases more particularly in: |                 |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| United States                           | 181 employees   |\n| Mexico                                  | 1,159 employees |\n| Poland                                  | 1,383 employees |\n| France                                  | 1,296 employees |\n| Tunisia                                 | 732 employees   |\n| Germany                                 | 240 employees   |\n| Spain                                   | 82 employees    |\n| Belgium                                 | 13 employees    |\n| Italy                                   | 10 employees    |\n\nImage /page/61/Figure/9 description: The image shows the text '2 employees are based in Singapore, and Morocco.'\n\nImage /page/61/Figure/10 description: The image is a stacked bar chart comparing data from 2022 and 2023. The y-axis ranges from 500 to 6,000. For 2022, the stacked bars represent different categories: France and Growth Overseas (1,208), Europe-Americas (2,115), North Africa (696), North America (1,296), and Others. For 2023, the corresponding values are: France and Growth Overseas (1,296), Europe-Americas (1,728), North Africa (732), North America (1,340), and Others. The chart also indicates percentage changes between the two years for each category: +7%, -18%, +5%, and +3%.\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **3. SHARING AND ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH ETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES AND CONDUCT**\n\nLACROIX is committed to conducting its activities according to operational principles and conduct founded on respect and integrity. Its requirements in terms of transparency and combating corruption have been strengthened by the obligations introduced under the \"Sapin II\" Law.\n\nThe Group's strategic development plan, particularly in terms of business development and international growth, further underlines its requirements with regard to business ethics and behaviours, combating corruption, and compliance.\n\nLACROIX has strengthened its governance and anti-corruption mechanisms and pursues a policy of zero tolerance towards corruption in all its activities and across all territories where it operates. These actions are undertaken at the very highest level of the Company's Management.\n\n## **3.1 Combating corruption**\n\nLACROIX conducts an ongoing process of identifying and assessing its main risks, leading to the reinforcement of its internal rules within the framework of its codes of conduct, which cover in particular the fight against corruption and the rules to observe in competition matters. It has also drawn up practical guides to help manage risks on a day-to-day basis, including a policy on gifts and entertainment. These documents are given to new employees and can be accessed by anyone at any time on the Group's legal intranet.\n\nThe teams most exposed to corruption-related requests (sales, purchases, etc.) are trained in the applicable anticorruption procedure. By the end of 2023, more than 670 employees had received training in anti-corruption rules.\n\n## **3.2 Whistleblowing system**\n\nLACROIX has a centralised whistleblowing system for collecting and processing reports of any actual or potential breaches of the law, regulations, and LACROIX's principles, guidelines and internal policies, including the applicable \"anti-corruption\" and \"competition\" Codes of Conduct.\n\nProcessing a whistleblower's report improves risk identification and prevention processes, from a perspective of continuous improvement and risk management.\n\n## **3.3 Selecting suppliers**\n\nIn 2023, LACROIX defined its Responsible Purchasing policy and set up 8 working groups aimed in particular at improving the CSR practices of its partners, identifying eco-designed solutions, reducing its packaging consumption and optimising its logistics flows.\n\nTo take better account of the CSR performance of our partners, in addition to their economic, logistics and quality performance, we have introduced an annual assessment of our strategic suppliers, which takes into account their ethical, social and environmental practices.\n\nWe aim to have 75% of our purchasing volume covered by this CSR assessment by 2025.\n\nLACROIX's Responsible Purchasing policy is also reflected in a code of good conduct addressed to all suppliers, who must undertake to comply with it.\n\nOur Purchasing Department, in partnership with our Quality Department, conducts audits of our suppliers in order to ensure that our requirements are duly met.\n\nThese audits may concern several aspects at once, such as the ability of the supplier to meet our needs, their technical capabilities, their quality system management, their adherence to environmental regulations, and their compliance with labour legislation.\n\nEach year, LACROIX also updates a risk map of its supply chain, taking into account country risk, financial risk and potential monopoly situations in order to better assess risks and prioritise security measures accordingly.\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **3.4 Equal treatment and non-discrimination**\n\nIn all the countries in which it operates, LACROIX observes the principles set out in the ILO Conventions, in particular the \"Fundamental Conventions\" concerning fundamental rights at work: freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour, the effective abolition of child labour, and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.\n\nLACROIX employs staff with diverse profiles from quite a broad range of geographical origins. LACROIX regards diversity, inclusion, and multiculturalism as vital factors for complementarity and enrichment. LACROIX asserts its commitment to work towards equal employment and against discrimination, and reaffirms its commitment to eliminate any form of discrimination with respect to employment and to the promotion of diversity.\n\nWithin the framework of company-level agreements and targeted actions, LACROIX encourages diversity within its teams, defines objectives and measures in favour of gender equality in the workplace and promotes the employment of people with disabilities through part-payment of apprenticeship taxes to the GIRPEH (disabled employment association), and more generally seeks to combat workplace discrimination, particularly through the implementation of its key processes such as recruitment, individual assessments, wage increase policies, etc. In 2023, no cases of discrimination were reported.\n\n## **3.5 Geopolitical risks – Service continuity**\n\nThe LACROIX Group has identified the areas in which it has significant manufacturing activity and which are particularly exposed to geopolitical risks. It is the group's Electronics business that is mainly affected, with delivery issues for its customers that can be significant. Accordingly, business continuity plans (BCPs) are drawn up in order to be in a position to best meet commitments made, even in a crisis. Zriba's BCP proved its robustness during the fire that affected the site in 2019.\n\nPreventive and corrective measures are taken. From a preventive point of view, there is a system for identifying risks as early as possible (weak signals, global assessments, information on the sector, etc.). As far as corrective measures are concerned, measures are taken at operational level (organisation of production, reallocation of production between sites, building up safety stocks), at the logistics level (storage locations, transport flows, supplier relations), and also at product design level, in order to ensure great reactivity in the event of a crisis.\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **4.

activity.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **5. CONTRIBUTING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE REGIONAL SOCIO-ECONOMIC FABRIC**\n\nLACROIX plays a significant role in terms of local employment (direct and indirect) and regional development.\n\nThe ELECTRONICS business is a major economic player in its areas of activity in France (more than 450 jobs in the Communauté des Mauges, more than 350 jobs also in the Nantes basin and more than 250 jobs in the Rennes basin), in Tunisia (second largest employer in the Zriba enterprise zone with nearly 700 direct jobs) and in Poland (third largest employer in the Kwidzyn region with approximately 1,800 direct jobs). It plays a key role in regional balance within the rural areas in which it is based on each of these sites.\n\nAcross all the areas of activity in which it operates, LACROIX seeks to contribute to economic, social, and regional development through direct initiatives or support for local initiatives.\n\n### **5.1 Economic development**\n\nImage /page/65/Picture/6 description: The image shows the logo for INNOVATION LAB BY LACROIX. The words \"INNOVATION LAB\" are in large, bold, dark blue letters. Below that, the words \"BY LACROIX\" are in smaller, dark blue letters. To the right of \"BY LACROIX\" are three red bars that are slanted to the right. The bars are on top of a red rectangle.\n\nLocated near Rennes, **Innovation Lab by LACROIX** is developing a network of partners and working to discover new uses and develop new technologies.\n\nThe Lab interacts with many local stakeholders to develop ideas and promote innovative, concrete and deployable solutions to today's and tomorrow's societal challenges and problems: schools, research laboratories, start-ups, local authorities, companies.\n\nThe team's actions with local and business ecosystems are key: to quickly identify companies that can help us meet today's challenges and jointly develop tomorrow's solutions with them, to share best practices within our ecosystem in order to challenge our current processes and to inspire each other in order to generate innovative projects hand in hand.\n\nImage /page/65/Picture/10 description: The image shows a logo with a stylized fox on the left and the text \"#ANGERS FRENCHTECH\" on the right. The fox is depicted in a geometric, low-poly style, with shades of red and pink. The text is in a sans-serif font and is colored gray. The hashtag symbol is placed before \"ANGERS\", and \"FRENCHTECH\" is positioned below \"#ANGERS\".\n\n#### **Commitment to intelligent territories**\n\nBeyond his missions within LACROIX, Stéphane Gervais, EVP Strategic Innovation of the LACROIX group, is closely involved in the territories and particularly in the **French Tech in Angers,** where he devotes his time and skills to the community on the Smart City theme, as well as in Nantes, where he is a member of the assessment committee of the **Nantes City Lab.**\n\nHe is also involved in the development of international mid-sized cities within the framework of **SIIVIM** and is a member of the OECD's **\"Smart Cities and Inclusive Growth\"** group.\n\nImage /page/65/Picture/14 description: The image is a circular logo or emblem with a blurred background of what appears to be a modern transportation hub, possibly a train station or airport. The central text is in French, with the word \"CHAIRE\" in a smaller, lighter font above the phrase \"MOBILITÉ DANS UNE VILLE DURABLE\" which translates to \"Mobility in a Sustainable City.\" The text is sandwiched between two thin, horizontal red lines. The overall design is clean and suggests a focus on sustainable urban mobility.\n\nLACROIX is a partner of the **\"Mobility in a sustainable city\" Research Chair** of the **Rennes 1 Foundation** with Rennes Métropole, the Legendre group, Keolis Rennes and the SNCF. The chair is held by Laurent Denant-Boëmont and François Bodin, research professors respectively at the *Centre de Recherche en Economie et Management* and the *Institut de Recherche en Informatique et Systèmes Aléatoires*: It works on issues at metropolitan level, both in terms of socio-economic studies (behavioural studies and public policy evaluation) and experimentation of innovative technological solutions, and also considers cybersecurity issues for smart-cities. In these fields of expertise, the Chair is involved in the creation of innovative companies and services, and participates in collaborative research projects\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\n\nImage /page/66/Picture/1 description: The image contains the logo for \"we network ACCÉLÉRATEUR D'INDUSTRIE\". The logo features a stylized letter \"N\" in teal, with a rounded shape and a small teal dot above it. Below the symbol, the words \"we network\" are written in a bold, dark blue font. Underneath \"we network\", the phrase \"ACCÉLÉRATEUR D'INDUSTRIE\" is written in a smaller, lighter blue font.\n\nThe **We Network** cluster is a resource centre for smart systems (continuous improvement, AIV, cobots, IT, system integration, additive manufacturing, and IoT) of which **Vincent Bedouin** has been President since its creation. This cluster is based in Angers, an area with an industrial tradition and that is home to the **greatest density of electronic production sites** in France (25% of all employment in the French electronics industry, or 50,000 jobs). The key roles of We Network are:\n\n- **• To promote** the potential of the French professional electronics sector (laboratories, design offices, industrial manufacturers, educational institutes),\n- **• To support electronics stakeholders** and users (all fields, all locations) with innovative projects,\n- **• To oversee the WISE programme,** offering advice and expertise at European level to stakeholders in electronic design and production in western France (Brittany, Centre, and Loire).\n\n## **5.2 Promotion of industry professions**\n\nMinistère\nde l'Économie\net des Finances\n\nImage /page/66/Picture/8 description: The image is a poster for \"La Semaine de l'Industrie\" (Industry Week), which takes place from November 27th to December 1st, 2023. The poster features a stylized illustration of three people working in an industrial setting. One person is wearing a white hard hat and holding a tablet, another is wearing a white hard hat and adjusting a valve on a pink pipe, and the third is sitting in front of a laptop. The text \"AVEC L'INDUSTRIE, FABRIQUE TON AVENIR\" (With Industry, Build Your Future) is prominently displayed on the poster.\n\nLACROIX regularly takes part in events intended to raise awareness of the industry's professions and to strengthen the link between the Company and its stakeholders, in universities above all.\n\nIn Poland, the Electronics Activity is pursuing its cooperation with 2 local universities to promote professions within the electronics industry. As such, as part of its \"School close to work\" programme. The various sites regularly welcome visits from young students to raise their awareness of industrial jobs.\n\nThe Electronics Activity also contributes to the content of technical programmes in order to provide the best employment opportunities for young students.\n\nLACROIX also regularly participates in professional forums that take place near the Group's various sites.\n\nLACROIX remains faithful to the \"Industry Week\" organised by the French Metal Industry and Trade Union. As part of the 2023 event, LACROIX employees spoke with teachers and students in discussion workshops organised by schools, local employment initiatives, and colleges.\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **6. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT**\n\nLACROIX's role as a technology partner in the fields of Smart City, Smart Environment, and Smart Industry puts it at the heart of environmental preservation challenges. The Group's teams design increasingly smart products and solutions to reduce urban light pollution and traffic in cities, optimise water resource management, consume less energy, etc.\n\nIn its operations and development, LACROIX strives to reduce its environmental footprint and encourages its stakeholders to do likewise.\n\nTo that end, the Group is pursuing a proactive policy aimed at achieving **ISO 14001** certification for all its main industrial sites.\n\nAll these sites have an organisation and management systems that enable them to monitor and reduce the environmental impact of their activities. The indicators monitored ensure the effectiveness of corrective measures and continuous improvements made.\n\nIn addition, all the Group's sites make sure to:\n\n- Use environmentally friendly processes\n- Work to reduce and recover waste\n- Manage energy and water consumption\n- Reduce their carbon footprint\n\nIn 2023, to further improve our practices, we launched \"Eco-flux\" diagnostics, a scheme set up by ADEME and Bpifrance to optimise energy, materials, waste and water flows. We have started with our main French sites and will be extending the scheme internationally in 2024.\n\nFinally, we have launched the *Committed Site* initiative, which aims to make the Group's positive impact strategy a reality on our sites. Each site has set up a working group, which makes proposals and takes actions in a number of areas (energy, waste, food, mobility, biodiversity, etc.).\n\n### **6.1 Waste reduction and recovery**\n\nLACROIX's activities generate various types of waste: WEEE, plastics, metals, cardboard, mixed waste, hazardous waste...\n\n2,161 tonnes of common industrial waste was generated in 2023, up from 1,681 tonnes in 2022. This difference is mainly due to a reporting error in 2022 at our Mexican site.\n\nThe quantity of hazardous industrial waste produced remains limited and under control at 173 tonnes, down from 217 tonnes in 2022.\n\nLACROIX's sites work to reduce the amount of waste they generate and entrust their waste to approved waste collection and recovery service providers.\n\nIn 2023, 75% of the common industrial waste generated was recycled, compared with 93% in 2022. This sharp fall is explained by a more accurate categorisation of waste categories and end-of-life scenarios in 2023.\n\nOn all its production sites, the LACROIX Group has set up systematic sorting of hazardous waste, which is also entrusted to approved service providers.\n\nFinally, the Group is also working with its suppliers and customers to reduce packaging waste by introducing reusable or recyclable packaging, such as shuttle crates.\n\nImage /page/67/Figure/21 description: The image shows a bar graph comparing the amount of ordinary industrial waste (OIW) and hazardous industrial waste (HIW) in tonnes for the years 2022 and 2023. In 2022, the OIW was 1,681 tonnes and the HIW was 277 tonnes. In 2023, the OIW was 2,161 tonnes and the HIW was 173 tonnes. Additionally, the image states that 75% of OIW is recycled.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **6.2 Energy consumption management**\n\nIn 2023, the overall energy consumption of the Group's sites remained stable.\n\nTo reduce energy consumption and improve the energy performance of its sites, LACROIX regularly invests in heating systems and building management systems (which intelligently control and regulate boilers, air heaters and other pieces of equipment).\n\n| Consumption<br>levels | 2023 | 2022 |\n|-----------------------|------|------|\n| Electricity           | 28.1 | 24   |\n| Gas                   | 3.8  | 7.5  |\n| Heating systems       | 1.8  | 1.8  |\n| Fuel oil              | 0.1  | 0    |\n| TOTAL (GWh)           | 33.8 | 33.3 |\n\nLACROIX also continues to invest in more energyefficient LED lighting systems on most of its sites.\n\nIn 2023, the Group joined the Estuaire Energie cooperative, with a view to supplying its French sites over the coming years through renewable power purchase agreements (PPAs). Investigations are also underway at the Group's largest sites abroad, in Poland, Tunisia and Mexico.\n\n## **6.3 Greenhouse gas emissions**\n\n#### **The LACROIX Group's carbon footprint**\n\nAs an international industrial company, LACROIX has a responsibility to act to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\n\nIn 2022, with the support of an external consultancy, LACROIX carried out a complete carbon assessment (scopes 1, 2 and 3) of all its activities in 2021, supplemented in 2023 by the carbon assessment of the American subsidiary of its Electronics business, acquired in the final days of 2021.\n\nThe LACROIX Group's total carbon footprint in 2021, including its American subsidiary, was 3.571 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2e):\n\n- Scope 1 = 2.8 Kt CO2e\n- Scope 2 = 12.1 Kt CO2e\n- Scope 3 upstream = 588 Kt CO2e\n- Scope 3 downstream = 2,968 Kt CO2e.\n\nThe main types of emission making up this footprint are as follows:\n\n- Use of the products sold: 2,931 KtCO2e, or 82% of the Group's footprint\n- Purchases (production and non-production): 569 KtCO2e, or 16% of the Group's footprint\n- Freight: 23 KtCO2e, 74% from upstream freight and 26% from downstream freight\n- End of life of sold products: 20 KtCO2e, including the collection, sorting and recovery of WEEE, plastic, metal and cardboard that make up our products and their packaging\n- Energy: 14 KtCO2e, from our consumption of electricity (87%), natural gas (10%) and district heating (3%).\n- Travel: 8 KtCO2e, from commuting (85%) and business trips (15%)\n\nIt should be noted that from 2024 (for financial year 2023), LACROIX will conduct an annual carbon audit of all its activities, in order to report on the achievement of its GHG emission reduction targets (see below).\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **LACROIX climate strategy**\n\nIn March 2023, LACROIX made a commitment to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to publicly announce GHG emission reduction targets aligned with the Paris Agreements within no more than two years.\n\nIn order to set these targets and build a climate trajectory and an operational, budgeted roadmap, in November 2023 we launched an *ACT Step by step* project, a scheme created and subsidised by ADEME.\n\nThroughout 2024, we will be holding workshops with representatives of the various business lines (finance, R&D, purchasing, production, marketing, etc.) from our 3 main activities (Electronics, City and Environment), in order to build the Group's climate trajectory and set GHG emission reduction targets that will be submitted to SBTi.\n\n## **6.4 Sustainable mobility**\n\nIn 2023 we launched a Sustainable Mobility Plan to promote low-carbon modes of transport for commuter journeys, which account for 85% of travel-related emissions within the Group. The plan, which has been rolled out at all Group sites with the exception of two sites at our US subsidiary, promotes carpooling, public transport and cycling.\n\nIn France, this means:\n\n- Carpooling: in early 2023, we signed a partnership agreement with BlaBlaCar Daily to encourage carpooling (welcome bonus, partial subsidy of journeys, communication campaigns, etc.)\n- Public transport: where possible, we set up partnerships with the local authorities where our sites are located so that our employees can benefit from reduced season ticket prices. This is particularly true of our sites in the Nantes and Rennes conurbations.\n- Cycling: in 2023 we introduced the Sustainable Mobility Package, which partly subsidises journeys made by our employees who come by bike or scooter.\n\nInternational initiatives depend on the local context and regulations. For example, our Kwidzyn site in Poland has developed a carpooling scheme for the site's employees, and our Zriba site in Tunisia has set up special bus services reserved for LACROIX employees.\n\nImage /page/69/Picture/12 description: A person is riding a white bicycle on a paved road.

**STATUTORY AUDITORS' REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n#### **LACROIXGroup**\n\nYear ended 31 December 2023\n\nTo the General Meeting of Shareholders of Lacroix Group,\n\n## **Opinion**\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your general meeting of shareholders, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Lacroix Group for the accounting period ended 31 December 2023.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n### **Basis for Opinion**\n\n#### **Audit Framework**\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n#### **Independence**\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors (Code de déontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes) for the period from 1 January 2023 to the date of our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014.\n\n## **Justification of Assessments – Key Audit Matters**\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 821 53 and R. 821-180 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### **Measurement of the recoverable amount of goodwill**\n\n#### **Risk identified**\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the net value of goodwill is €83,506k.\n\nAs stated in Note 6.4.4 \"Business combinations\" to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is subject to an impairment test at least once a year and more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired.\n\nImpairment tests are carried out at the level of the Cash Generating Units (CGUs). They consist in comparing the carrying amount of a CGU to its recoverable amount.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the goodwill of each CGU defined by your group is determined based on future cash flows calculated for five-year periods, a discount rate of 9% for the City and Environment CGUs and 9.4% for the Electronics CGU, and a perpetual growth rate of 2% as stated in Note 8.1 \"Goodwill\" to the consolidated financial statements. The measurement of the recoverable amount of goodwill is a key audit matter due to the materiality of goodwill in relation to your group's financial statements and the use of assumptions and estimates to make this assessment.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Our response**\n\nWe analyzed the key data and assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill, by including a valuation specialist in our audit team to perform these various analyses: We:\n\n- We assessed the operational assumptions adopted to establish the cash flow projections, notably by comparing them to past actual figures and market prospects.\n- reviewed the reconciliation of the business plans used for the impairment tests with the budgets approved by the Management;\n- examined the methods used to determine the discount rate and the perpetual growth rate and their consistency with the underlying market assumptions;\n- tested the mathematical accuracy of the models and recalculated the amounts.\n\nLastly, we assessed the appropriateness of the information disclosed in Notes 6.4.4 \"Business combinations\" and 8.1 \"Goodwill\" to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### **Measurement and presentation of the impacts of the ongoing planned sale of the Signaling BU**\n\n#### **Risk identified**\n\nAs announced on 9 February 2023, your Group intends to sell its Signaling BU and announced on 14 December 2023 that it was in exclusive negotiations with AIAC for this takeover.\n\nAs stated in Note 6.5.16 \"Assets and groups of assets held for sale and abandoned activities\" to the consolidated financial statements, all of the assets and the liabilities related to the abandoned activities or businesses held for sale are presented on a separate line of assets and liabilities, as they would appear upon sale after elimination of the intragroup positions.\n\nNote 7.3.2 \"Planned sale of the Signaling BU\" sets out your Group's analysis of the nature of the assets and liabilities being transferred with regard to IFRS 5, and presents the main financial impacts on your Group's consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2023. In light of the estimated value of the sale, the historic goodwill of the Signaling BU has been fully impaired, as has a share of non-current assets for a total amount of €3,735k.\n\nWe considered this to be a key audit matter in view of the amounts involved, the unusual nature of the transaction and the use of assumptions and estimates for this valuation\n\n#### **Our response**\n\nWe analyzed the data and key assumptions used for the valuation and presentation of the assets\n\nand liabilities to be sold. Our work consisted in the following in particular:\n\n- familiarizing ourselves with the analysis performed by your Group to characterize the transaction in view of the provisions of IFRS 5 ;\n- analyzing the identification and measurement of the assets and liabilities to be sold in view of the provisions of IFRS 5.\n\nLastly, we assessed the appropriateness of the information disclosed in Notes 6.5.16 \"Assets and groups of assets held for sale and abandoned activities\" and 7.3.2 \"Planned sale of the Signaling BU\" to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## **Specific Verifications**\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations of the information relating to the Group given in the Board of Directors' management report.\n\nWe have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe attest that the consolidated non-financial statement required by Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) is included in the information relating to the Group given in the management report, it being specified that, in accordance with Article L. 823-10 of this Code, we have verified neither the fair presentation nor the consistency with the consolidated financial statements of the information contained in this statement.\n\n## **Other Verifications or Information Required by Laws and Regulations**\n\n#### **Format of presentation of the consolidated financial statements included in the annual financial report**\n\nIn accordance with the professional standard applicable in France relating to the procedures performed by statutory auditors regarding the annual and consolidated financial statements prepared in the European single electronic format, we have also verified that the preparation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L. 451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code monétaire et financier), prepared under the CEO's responsibility, complies with the single electronic format defined in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2019/815 of 17 December 2018. As it relates to the consolidated financial statements, our work includes verifying that the tagging in the financial statements complies with the format defined in the aforementioned Regulation.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\nOn the basis of our work, we conclude that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the consolidated annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nDue to the technical limitations inherent in the block-tagging of consolidated financial statements in the European single electronic format, it is possible that the content of certain tagging in our notes to the consolidated financial statements are not reproduced identically to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### **Appointment of the Statutory Auditors**\n\nWe were appointed as statutory auditors of Lacroix Group by your General Meeting of Shareholders held on 11 May 2021 for MAZARS and on 18 March 2009 for ERNST & YOUNG et Autres.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, MAZARS was in its third year and ERNST & YOUNG et Autres in its fifteenth year of total uninterrupted engagement.\n\nPreviously, the firm Exco Atlantique (acquired by ERNST & YOUNG Audit and renamed ERNST & YOUNG Atlantique in 2008) was statutory auditor.\n\n### **Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures. The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n### **Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n#### **Objectives and Audit Approach**\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 821 55 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements.\n- Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial\n\nstatements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.\n\n- Report to the Audit Committee\n- We submit to the Audit Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report significant deficiencies, if any, in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n- Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n- We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France as set out in particular in Articles L. 821 27 to L. 821 34 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors (Code de déontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes). Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nSaint-Herblain and Nantes, 2 April 2024\n\n**The Statutory Auditors (French original signed by)**\n\nMAZARS Arnaud Le Néen\n\nMAZARS 4, rue Edith Piaf Immeuble Asturia A 44800 Saint-Herblain S.A. à directoire et conseil de surveillance au capital de € 8 320 000 784 824 153 R.C.S.

A provision for impairment is recorded when the value-in-use of equity securities is less than the gross value. This value-in-use is assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the general situation and the sales and earnings outlook for each of the companies concerned, consistent with your group's development plans.\n\nWe considered that the valuation of the equity securities is a key audit matter in view of their materiality in relation to your company's financial statements and the level of judgement required to assess their value-in-use.\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Our response**\n\nWithin the scope of our audit of the financial statements, our work notably consisted in the following:\n\n- familiarizing ourselves with the valuation of the equity securities performed by your Company, the methods used and the underlying assumptions;\n- assessing the operational assumptions adopted to establish the sales and earnings forecasts for the subsidiaries by comparing them with past actual figures and market prospects.;\n- examining the consistency of the value-in-use thus determined and the recoverable amount used for the impairment tests performed on goodwill for the purposes of preparing your group's consolidated financial statements;\n- verifying the arithmetical accuracy of the valuein-use calculations performed by your company for the values deemed material.\n\n## **Specific Verifications**\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations.\n\n#### **Information given in the management report and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the shareholders**\n\nWe have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the Board of Directors' management report and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the shareholders.\n\nWe attest the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information relating to payment deadlines mentioned in Article D. 441-4 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).\n\n#### **Report on Corporate Governance**\n\nWe attest that the Board of Directors' Report on Corporate Governance sets out the information required by Articles L. 225-37-4, L. 22-10-10 and L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).\n\nConcerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of Article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to remunerations and benefits received by, or allocated to the directors and any other commitments made in their favor, we have verified its consistency with the financial statements, or\n\nwith the underlying information used to prepare these financial statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your Company from companies controlled thereby, included in the consolidation scope. Based on these procedures, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.\n\nWith respect to the information relating to items that your Company considered likely to have an impact in the event of a takeover bid or exchange offer, provided pursuant to Article L. 22-10-11 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), we have agreed this information to the source documents communicated to us.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, CONSOLIDATION METHODS, VALUATION METHODS AND RULES**\n\n## **6.1 General information on the Company**\n\nListed on Euronext Paris, Compartment C, LACROIX Group is a public limited company under French law.\n\nThe Group's registered office is located in 17 rue Océane, 44800 Saint Herblain, France.\n\nBeyond the \"direct\" imprint of its activity, LACROIX has a societal mission, reflected in its offer, which constitutes the Group's true purpose and a permanent bond between all its employees.\n\nIts mission is to provide its customers with simple, robust technologies, helping to bring out a safer, more sustainable world.\n\nThrough its activities, LACROIX harnesses its technological know-how in order to:\n\n- Transform streets and road infrastructure into fluid, safe, and sustainable living environments. LACROIX devices guide, optimise, and safeguard the flow of vehicles and people, allowing them to share streets and roads in greater harmony, taking account of the needs of all users and operators.\n- Digitalise and optimise the management of water and energy infrastructures. Drawing on its in-depth understanding of the sector and its operator customers, LACROIX helps improve the performance of their networks, save dwindling resources, and protect the environment.\n- Design and produce electronic products in critical fields such as the automotive, aeronautical, and home automation sectors or Industry 4.0 and support their needs in automation, digitalisation, and environmental performance.\n\n## **6.2 Accounting standards**\n\n### **6.2.1 General principles**\n\nThe annual financial statements are presented for the period ended 31 December 2023 by applying all the IFRS standards published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and adopted by the European Union. All the texts adopted by the European Union are available on the website of the European Commission at the following address:\n\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/finance/accounting/ias/index\\_ fr.htm.\n\nThese methods are identical to those adopted in the consolidated financial statements on 31 December 2022.\n\nThe Group does not apply IFRS standards that have not yet been approved by the European Union as at the closing date of the period. The Group has not opted for early application of standards and interpretations whose application is not mandatory for the 2023 financial year.\n\nTexts adopted by the European Union (mandatory application for periods opening on or after 1 January 2023) and final decisions of the IFRS IC issued in 2023.\n\n- Amendment to IAS 12 removal of the exception for initial recognition of deferred tax;\n- Amendment to IAS 1 Disclosure of Accounting Policies;\n- Amendment to IAS 8 clarification of the difference between an accounting estimate and an accounting policy.\n\nThese texts and decisions of the IFRS IC have no impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\n#### **6.2.2 Presentation of the financial statements**\n\nAssets held for sale or consumption as part of the normal operating cycle, or within 12 months of closing, as well as cash and cash equivalents, are considered to be \"current assets\".\n\n\"Current liabilities\" include debts due during the normal operating cycle or within 12 months after the closing of the financial year.\n\nOther assets or liabilities are considered as \"noncurrent\".\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **6.3 Use of estimations**\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the Group's management to exercise judgement, to make estimations, and to make assumptions that have an impact on the application of the accounting methods and on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThese underlying assumptions and estimations are established and reviewed continuously based on past experience and other factors considered reasonable in the circumstances. Actual values may differ from estimated values.\n\nThe underlying assumptions and estimations are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The impact of changes in accounting estimations is recognised over the period of the change if it affects only that period or during the period of the change and any subsequent periods if these are also affected by this change.\n\n## **6.4 Basis for consolidation**\n\n#### **6.4.1 Consolidation methods**\n\nSubsidiaries of the Group:\n\n- A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls a subsidiary when it has exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary, and has the ability to use its power to affect these returns. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements as from the date on which control is obtained until the control ceases.\n- Non-controlling interests are prorated to the net identifiable assets of the acquired entity on the date of acquisition. Changes in the percentage of the Group's holding in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for equity transactions between the Group and the non-controlling interest.\n\nAssociates and joint ventures:\n\n• Associates are entities for which the Company has significant influence over financial and operating policies without having control or joint control over them. Joint ventures are partnerships that give the Group joint control, whereby it has rights regarding the net assets of the partnership and no rights regarding its assets or obligations to assume for its liabilities. Associates and joint ventures are recognised as per the equity method. The consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the total amount of profits and losses recognised by the joint ventures and equity method companies, until the date on which the significant influence or joint control ends.\n\nMethods applied to the Group:\n\n• Based on the provisions of IFRS 11 (structure of the partnership, legal form of distinct vehicles, contractual provisions and other facts and circumstances), the Group does not have any joint ventures.\n\nThe scope of consolidation and the list of subsidiaries are provided in Note 5.\n\n#### **6.4.2 Conversion methods for foreign companies' financial statements**\n\nThe financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are converted as follows:\n\n- For the balance sheet, at the currency's exchange rate on the closing date.\n- For the income statement, at the average rate on the closing date.\n- Currency translation differences are directly recognised in shareholders' equity under \"Currency translation differences\".\n\nThe table below shows the changes to the currency parities applied:\n\n| 1ML = €X           | Opening | Average | Closing | Average<br>N-1 |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|---------|----------------|\n| Zloty (PLN)        | 0.21364 | 0.22023 | 0.23044 | 0.2134         |\n| Dollar (USD)       | 0.93756 | 0.92476 | 0.90498 | 0.94944        |\n| CFP Franc<br>(XPF) | 0.00838 | 0.00838 | 0.00838 | 0.00838        |\n| CFA Franc<br>(XAF) | 0.00152 | 0.00152 | 0.00152 | 0.00152        |\n| SG Dollar<br>(SGD) | 0.69930 | 0.68849 | 0.68535 | 0.6891         |\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recognised at the exchange rate on the day of the transaction. Gains and losses resulting from the payment of these transactions and the conversion of receivables and payables in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.\n\n#### **6.4.3 Elimination of intra-group transactions**\n\nIn accordance with the applicable regulations, balance sheet amounts and unrealised income and expenses resulting from intra-group transactions are eliminated when preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains and losses arising from transactions with associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in these associates.\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **6.4.4 Business combinations**\n\nGoodwill is subject to impairment testing performed at least once a year and more often where events or circumstances show indicators of impairment.\n\nImpairment tests are carried out at the level of the Cash Generating Units (CGUs). They consist in comparing the book value of a CGU to its recoverable value.\n\n• The recoverable value is defined as the higher of the asset's net selling price and its value in use.\n\nThe Group has adopted a testing methodology based on the DCF (Discounted Cash Flows) method using Business Plans prepared for each activity (with the activity corresponding to the notion of CGU).\n\nNote 8.1 presents the assumptions made.\n\n### **6.5 Valuation methods and rules**\n\nThe principles and methods used by the Group are as follows:\n\n#### **6.5.1 Intangible assets**\n\nIntangible assets are recognised at their acquisition cost, minus any accumulated amortisations and impairment losses, if applicable.\n\n#### **Research & Development costs**\n\nResearch expenditure is recognised as expenses.\n\nAs regards development expenses, the Group has designed a monitoring procedure to collect all useful information for identifying, valuing, and monitoring expenditure.\n\nWhere expenditures classified as development expenses meet the criteria for capitalisation, they are capitalised. Otherwise, they are recognised as expenses.\n\n#### **Amortisation and impairment**\n\nIntangible fixed assets have a finite useful life. Amortisation is recognised as an expense, on a linear basis, based on the estimated useful life of the intangible asset.\n\n|                                                                             | Duration                                                                                               |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Concessions, patents, licences                                              | Shorter of the legal period of protection or the useful life of the asset                              |\n| Software                                                                    | When capitalisable, from 3 to 10 years                                                                 |\n|                                                                             | Duration                                                                                               |\n| Land improvements                                                           | 7 to 30 years                                                                                          |\n| Buildings for operations                                                    | 25 to 50 years                                                                                         |\n| Building installations and<br>fixtures of properties owned by<br>the Group  | 15 to 40 years                                                                                         |\n| Building installations and<br>fixtures of properties rented by<br>the Group | Shorter of the term of the lease<br>(including potential renewals)<br>and the useful life of the asset |\n| Equipment and tools                                                         | 8 to 15 years                                                                                          |\n| Transportation equipment                                                    | 5 years                                                                                                |\n| Office equipment and furniture                                              | 3 to 15 years                                                                                          |\n\nThey are subject to impairment testing where there is an indicator of impairment.\n\n• Indefinite-life intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing. Impairment tests are based on discounted future cash flows.\n\n#### **6.5.2 Tangible assets**\n\n#### **Non-current tangible assets**\n\nTangible assets are valued at their acquisition cost, minus any accumulated amortisations and impairment, or at their production costs for the part produced by the Group.\n\nWhere a tangible asset has significant components with different useful lives, these components are recognised separately.\n\n#### **Amortisation and impairment**\n\nAmortisation is recognised as an expense, on a linear basis, based on the estimated useful life of the tangible asset.\n\nThe amortisation periods used are as follows:\n\nThe book values of tangible assets are subject to impairment testing where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value may not be recoverable. Thus, if the book value of a tangible asset is higher than its estimated recoverable value, an impairment loss is recognised for this asset.\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **6.5.3 Lease contracts**\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 16, when a lease contract is entered into, the Group must record a liability in the balance sheet corresponding to the discounted future payments of the fixed portion of the lease payments, in exchange for rights of use of the asset amortised over the duration of the contract.\n\nIn accordance with the exemptions provided for by this standard, the Group excludes contracts with a residual duration of less than 12 months and contracts relating to low-value assets (less than \\$5K).\n\nThe amount of the liability is significantly dependent on the assumptions made regarding the duration of the obligations and, to a lesser extent, the discount rate.\n\nThe duration of the contract generally used to calculate the liability is the duration of the contract initially negotiated, without taking into account early termination or extension options, except in special cases.\n\nIn accordance with the decision made by the IFRS Interpretation Committee (\"IFRS IC\") when the rental commitment is less than 12 months but assets have been capitalised in relation to this contract, the Group records a lease liability over a period consistent with the expected useful life of the invested assets.\n\nThe standard requires the discount rate for each contract to be determined by reference to the marginal borrowing rate of the contracting subsidiary. In practice, the marginal borrowing rate generally used is the sum of the risk-free rate by reference to its duration, a currency swap where applicable, the Group's credit risk, and a possible surcharge depending on the nature of the asset financed.\n\n#### **6.5.4 Financial assets**\n\nNon-current financial assets include investment securities and financial loans and receivables with a maturity of more than twelve months.\n\n- Investment securities are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.\n- Their fair value is measured on the basis of the stock market price on the closing date for listed securities. For unlisted securities, in the absence of specific events, their acquisition cost or share of net worth is considered the best possible estimate of fair value.\n- Financial loans and receivables are classified as assets generated by the business. They are valued at amortised cost. They are subject to a provision for depreciation as soon as there is an indication of impairment.\n\n#### **6.5.5 Financial risk management**\n\nForeign currency and interest rate hedging:\n\n• Hedging transactions are analysed by an independent expert in order to ensure that they comply with IAS 32 and IFRS 9 when they are of a significant nature.\n\n#### **6.5.6 Inventories and goods in progress**\n\nInventory and goods in progress are valued at the lowest point of their cost and their net realisable value. Cost is measured using the weighted average cost method. This cost includes the costs of materials and direct labour as well as indirect expenses strictly attributable to production.\n\nInternal margins included in inventories are eliminated in the consolidated financial statement.\n\nProvisions for impairment are calculated based on the difference between the gross value determined according to the principles described above and the probable net realisable value.\n\n#### **6.5.7 Trade accounts receivable**\n\nTrade accounts receivable and related accounts are valued at their fair value. Since accounts receivable are due within one year, they are not discounted. A provision for impairment is recognised, if necessary, depending on the likelihood of recovery at the closing date.\n\nThe Group, at the initiative of some of its main partner customers, has implemented reverse factoring contracts. The substantial analysis of these reverse factoring contracts set out in IFRS 9 confirmed that the 3 main de-recognition criteria applicable in particular to disposals of receivables were met, namely:\n\n- The expiry or transfer of the contractual rights over cash flows relating to the asset,\n- The transfer of almost all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the asset (credit risk due to the debtor's insolvency, carry trade risk inherent to payment deferral/delay compared to the normal due date, and risk of dilution resulting mainly from litigations and settlement differences (credit notes, compensation, etc.),\n- The loss of asset control.\n\n#### **6.5.8 Cash and cash equivalents**\n\n\"Cash in hand\" includes bank balances and easily liquid investments.\n\nBank overdrafts are included in borrowings among short-term debts in the balance sheet liabilities.\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **6.5.9 Capital and reserves**\n\nWhen the Group buys back or sells treasury shares:\n\n- The price paid including expenses incurred for their acquisition net of tax is deducted from shareholders' equity under \"Treasury shares\" until their disposal.\n- When they are sold, the capital gain or loss is recognised in shareholders' equity.\n\n#### **6.5.10 Public grants**\n\nGrants are included in the financial statements, where there is reasonable assurance that:\n\n- The Group will comply with the conditions attached to the financing.\n- The grants will be received.\n- For public grants attached to assets, the Group has elected to present the financing as a deduction from the value of the related asset.\n\n#### **6.5.11 Provisions for other liabilities and charges**\n\nWhere the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) arising from a past event and if it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and if the obligation can be reliably estimated, the Group then recognises a provision.\n\n#### **6.5.12 Employee benefits**\n\nRetirement benefits:\n\n- The Group recognises a provision for retirement benefits, based on collective agreements. This is a defined benefit plan. The provision is valued by an independent actuary. Note 8.11.1 presents the assumptions made.\n- These valuations take into account in particular the future compensation level, the probable active life of employees, life expectancy, and staff turnover.\n- The present value of commitments as thus valued is recognised in the balance sheet, after deduction of the fair value of assets paid by companies of the Group to financial institutions.\n- Actuarial gains and losses, arising mainly from changes in actuarial assumptions and the difference between results estimated based on the actuarial assumptions and the actual results, are recognised to the full extent in shareholders' equity.\n- The financial cost and the cost of services rendered are recognised as an expense for the financial year.\n\n#### Share-based payments:\n\n- Share subscription or purchase option plans granted to employees must be valued at their fair value, that must be charged to the income statement with a corresponding entry for reserves over the vesting period (2 to 4 years) for employees.\n- The fair value of options is calculated using the Black & Scholes model. The cost is thus charged over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in reserves.\n- The fair value of bonus shares is calculated using the binomial model to take into account performance-related conditions.\n\n#### **6.5.13 Borrowings**\n\nBorrowings are initially recognised at their fair value, net of the related commissions.\n\nThe portion of financial debts falling due within one year is classified as current financial debts.\n\n#### **6.5.14 Commitments to purchase noncontrolling interests**\n\nNon-controlling shareholders of some fully consolidated subsidiaries benefit from commitments to purchase their shares granted by the Group.\n\nThe Group recognises these commitments as follows:\n\n- the value of the commitment on the closing date is shown under \"Amounts due for business combinations\";\n- the commitment is recognised with a corresponding entry for Group share shareholders' equity;\n- subsequent variations are recognised as shareholders' equity, including the effects of financial discounting.\n- When a condition of presence is attached to these instruments, the group recognises an expense in the income statement for this specific part of the instrument, spread over the contractual period of presence.\n\n#### **6.5.15 Current and deferred taxes**\n\nA deferred tax amount is calculated for all existing temporary differences between the book value reflected in the consolidated balance sheet and the tax value of assets and liabilities.\n\nThe taxation rate used is that which the Group expects to pay or recover from the tax authorities and which has been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. As such, the Group has used the rate of 25% for the calculation of its deferred taxes in France.\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\nCurrent and differed tax assets and liabilities are not discounted and are classified in the balance sheet as non-current assets and liabilities.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that these taxes will be recovered over future financial years.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset for the same tax entity. The Group has two tax consolidation groups, one in France (headed by LACROIX Group) and the other in Spain (headed by LACROIX Sofrel Espana).\n\nDetails of these tax groups are given in note 5.\n\nTax rate by country:\n\n|               | Period 2023 |\n|---------------|-------------|\n| Germany       | 30.0%       |\n| United States | 21.0%       |\n| Spain         | 25.0%       |\n| France        | 25.0%       |\n| Italy         | 27.9%       |\n| Poland        | 19.0%       |\n| Tunisia       | 10.0%       |\n\n#### **6.5.16 Assets and groups of assets held for sale and discontinued operations**\n\nA discontinued operation is either a component of an entity from which it has separated or an operation classified as held for sale and:\n\n- which represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operation;\n- which is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or major geographical area of operation; or\n- which is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to be resold.\n\nAn operation is classified as discontinued only when the entity has disposed of the operation or at an earlier date when the operation meets the criteria for being classified as held for sale. When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative income statement and cash flow statement are restated as if the operation had met the criteria of a discontinued operation as from the date of opening of the comparative period.\n\nFurthermore, all assets and liabilities linked to discontinued operations or those held for sale are presented on a separate line of the assets and liabilities, as they would appear for a disposal after elimination of intra-group positions.\n\nDetails of businesses being sold are given in note 7.3.2\n\n#### **6.5.17 Revenue**\n\nRevenue from sales of goods and services is recognised once control of the goods or services has been transferred to the customer.\n\nDepending on the different revenue flows of the Group and, where necessary, the specifics of each contract, control is transferred either at a point in time or over the time.\n\nWhen it is established that the Group fulfils its performance obligations to customers on a progressive basis, the Group recognises revenue progressively by the cost approach.\n\nThe amounts recognised as revenue are based on the transaction prices stipulated in the contract for the amount of the consideration the Group expects to receive pursuant to contract clauses.\n\nThe transaction prices stipulated in contracts have no significant variable portions requiring estimations to be used. Group contracts do not stipulate payment deadlines of more than one year, and no financing component is recorded in this respect.\n\n#### **6.5.18 Earnings per share**\n\nBasic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, excluding shares bought by the Company and held as treasury shares.\n\nDiluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period adjusted for the conversion of dilutive instruments into ordinary shares.\n\nThe group has dilutive instruments, bonus shares.\n\n#### **6.5.19 Segment reporting**\n\nThe Group's segment reporting is based on the concept of business segments. The choice of this level and its breakdown reflects the Group's organisational structure and the risk and profitability differences.\n\n- Electronics Activity\n- Environment Activity\n- City Activity\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **7. COMPARABILITY OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE PERIOD**\n\n## **7.1 Accounting changes**\n\nNone\n\n## **7.2 Changes in consolidation scope and entry of minority shareholders**\n\nNone\n\n## **7.3 Significant events**\n\n#### **7.3.1 Key events of the period**\n\n#### **Cyberattack**\n\nOn 15 May 2023, LACROIX announced it had suffered a cyberattack which mainly affected the French (Beaupréau), German (Willich) and Tunisian (Zriba) sites of the Electronics activity.\n\nThe main financial impacts of the cyber attack on the Group's financials are as follows:\n\n- The operating loss incurred amounts to €1.8M and is covered by the insurance policy;\n- Non recurring costs of €0.6M have been recognised as \"Other operating income and expenses\" (see 8.17).\n\n#### **Sale of the Saint Herblain building**\n\nLacroix City Saint Herblain sold its business building on 22 December 2023 then leased it back under a commercial lease. This sale and leaseback transaction was specifically restated according to IFRS 16, leading to the recognition of a consolidated capital gain of €2,360K. The impact of this restatement is detailed in note 8.4 - Leases.\n\n#### **LACROIX Electronics MI**\n\nThe year-end inventory review of the LACROIX Electronics MI (Ex-Firstronic) sites revealed counting and values differences of \\$3.3 M, in operating profits. Investigations were carried out to identify the origin of the deviations, their causes and the associated corrective action plans. Internal control deficiencies have prevented us from reconstructing all of these discrepancies. In particular, the dates of origin of the discrepancies cannot be broken down with sufficient reliability.\n\n#### **7.3.2 Proposed sale of the Signalisation BU**\n\nFor the record, in its annual sales press release dated 9 February 2023, LACROIX announced its intention to divest its Signalisation Business Unit (called \"BU\") (8% of LACROIX' turnover) in order to focus its investments on its strategic markets around industrial IoT and electronic equipment.\n\nFollowing this announcement, the Signalisation BU embarked on a gradual process of empowerment in preparation for the sale.\n\nOn 14 December 2023, LACROIX Group announced that it had entered into exclusive negotiations with AIAC with a view to acquiring this BU.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, in view of this planned disposal and in accordance with IFRS 5 - Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, the Signalisation Business Unit is presented in the consolidated financial statements as an asset being sold. The impact of reclassifications resulting from the application of this standard is presented in the \"Assets of activities held for sale\" column in the detailed tables in these notes. Assets held for sale include the historical goodwill of the Signalisation BU.\n\nGiven the estimated value of the disposal, a capital loss of €3,735K was recognised. Goodwill was fully written down, as was a share of non-current assets in the same amount.\n\nOn 18 March 2024, LACROIX announced the sale of the Signalisation BU (see Note 9.6 - Post-balance sheet events).\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe table below details the impact of the disposal on the balance sheet, as well as the assets and liabilities classified as

overdrafts\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe impact of this disposal is recognised in the income statement under \"Other operating income and expenses\" (see 8.17).\n\nAs the Signalisation Business Unit does not meet the definition of a discontinued operation under IFRS 5, the result of this BU in the process of being sold being sold is not isolated in the published income statement.\n\nThe Signalisation BU's main aggregates in the Group's consolidated financial statements break down as follows:\n\n| In €K   | Period 2023 | Period 2022 |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|\n| Revenue | 58,320      | 54,559      |\n| EBITDA  | 2,921       | (1,285)     |\n| EBIT    | 1,157       | (3,039)     |\n\nThe Signalisation BU also contributes to the amortisation of certain structural costs.\n\nIn addition, the profit or loss for the intervening period (from 1 January 2024 to the effective disposal date) and the change in net

When there is a material deviation, it is analysed to determine whether it is a one-off or structural deviation and is also re-contextualised according to the overall plan approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nA reasonably possible change (in the order of 0.5 percentage points) in the discount rates or COI would not lead to an impairment of the Group's goodwill.\n\n## **8.2 Intangible

process of allocating the acquisition price of Lacroix Electronics MI in 2021.\n\nThe difficulties encountered by Lacroix Electronics MI (including the rise in payroll costs and the sharp appreciation of the Mexican peso, the loss of productivity resulting in particular from saturation of production capacity before the opening of the new Juarez site), had a significant impact on the company's EBITDA and led to a review of the assumptions used for the valuation of the \"customer list\" asset. As a result, an exceptional writeoff of €10,814k was recognised.\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **8.3 Tangible assets**\n\n|

obtained in 2021 has been fully offset against the tax due in 2023.\n\n(2) Losses carried forward correspond to the capitalised tax loss bases of the French tax group for €20.2M, of LACROIX Electronics MI for €10.6M and LACROIX Electronics Beaupreau for €5.2M.\n\n(3) This concerns both deferred taxes on \"customer relationships\" recognised in intangible assets, which diminish as these intangible assets are amortised in the accounts (see 8.2), and deferred tax liabilities that the group recognises on tax deductible goodwill in the United States and Germany.\n\n(\\*) After an overall analysis of net deferred tax assets and liabilities by nature, this item takes into account the obligation to present deferred taxes in net value, within the scope of the tax consolidation group (Note 6.5.15).\n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **9. OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n## **9.1 Degree of exposure of the Group to financial risks**\n\n#### **9.1.1 Currency risk**\n\nOther than the Electronics Activity, the Group is not exposed to currency variation risks.\n\nIn the Electronics business, the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk, mainly with regard to component purchases, which are often denominated in USD or JPY, as well as other payroll costs and/or service purchases invoiced in TND, MXN and PLN.\n\nAs regards purchases in USD and JPY, the Company has contracts with its main customers enabling it to adjust the selling price of products according to changes in the EUR/USD exchange rate. Therefore, the currency risk for this item is under control. For the balance, the Company uses partial hedging of its needs to cover a target rate set each fiscal year. Purchases in USD and JPY amount to approximately €70 million annually, 80% of which is passed on to customers through contracts. For the remaining part, exchange rate hedging is carried out to secure a \"budget\" rate.\n\nExpenditure in TND, MXN and PLN (around €75 million) mainly concerns salaries and social charges for employees at the Tunisian, Mexican and Polish sites, and some local purchases. The Group's policy is to carry out forward hedging on the basis of forecast requirements, enabling a \"budget\" rate to be covered (one-year horizon). Changes in labour costs are also factored into the new commercial offers.\n\nGenerally speaking, the use of financial instruments is strictly limited to business requirements, and excludes any speculative activities.\n\nIn addition, specifically on financing activities, at the end of 2021 the group set up Cross Currency Swap (CCS) instruments in USD on a €30M loan.\n\n#### **9.1.2 Interest rate risk**\n\nNote 8.12.3 on \"Borrowings and financial debts\" shows that out of €103,844K of debt, €54,079K are at a fixed rate and €49,765K are at a variable rate.\n\nThe Group implements various financial instruments with several maturities to mitigate this risk. At the end of December 2023, the portion of financing at variable rates hedged by CAP, SWAP, COLLAR is 67% of the nominal value. 84% of total debt (variable and fixed rate) is hedged.\n\n#### **9.1.3 Liquidity risk**\n\nGross debt position for the Group amounts to €157,086K. Available cash amounts to €42,523K. The Group therefore considers its exposure to this risk to be low.\n\n#### **9.1.4 Credit risk**\n\nEach of the Group's activities has implemented a system for monitoring and managing customer risk, sometimes using credit insurance contracts for this purpose to protect from potential customer risk.\n\nCustomer profiles by sector of activity are described below:\n\n| Activities  | Main customer types                                                   |\n|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Electronics | French and foreign companies operating internationally                |\n| Environment | Public bodies and major water and electricity management stakeholders |\n| City        | Government authorities and major public works companies               |\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **9.1.5 Financial gearing**\n\nThe Group closely monitors its capital by controlling changes in its gearing.\n\n|                                          | Period 2023 | Period 2022 |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Borrowings and other financial debts     | 127,015     | 114,655     |\n| Bank overdrafts                          | 30,070      | 48,393      |\n| Other net financial debts                | (1,634)     | (1,638)     |\n| Cash and cash equivalents (see Note 8.9) | (42,523)    | (22,613)    |\n| Net debt position (1)                    | 112,928     | 138,797     |\n| Shareholders' equity                     | 190,057     | 193,885     |\n| Financial gearing                        | 59.4%       | 71.6%       |\n\n(1) Amounts due for business combinations are not included in the Group's gearing ratio.\n\n#### **9.1.6 Classification of financial assets and liabilities at fair value based on fair value levels**\n\nIFRS 13 (Fair Value Measurement) imposes a fair value hierarchy for financial instruments (the inputs to valuation techniques). The inputs are categorised as follows:\n\nLevel 1: direct reference to quoted (unadjusted) prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n\nLevel 2: a valuation technique that uses asset or liability inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly;\n\nLevel 3: valuation technique based on unobservable inputs.\n\n#### As at 31/12/2023\n\n| ASSETS                                                        | Amortized cost | Fair value<br>measured<br>through OCI | Fair value<br>measured<br>through P&L |

APPENDIX**\n\n## **3.1 Major events of the financial year**\n\n#### Cyberattack:\n\nOn 15 May 2023, LACROIX announced it had suffered a cyberattack which mainly affected the French (Beaupréau), German (Willich) and Tunisian (Zriba) sites of the Electronics activity.\n\nThe main financial impacts of the cyber attack on the Group's accounts are as follows:\n\n- Loss of revenue estimated at between €4M and €5M\n- The operating loss incurred amounts to €1.8M and is covered by the insurance company\n- Other exceptional costs totalled €0.6M, €0.3M of which was borne by LACROIX GROUP\n\n#### Proposed sale of the Road Signs BU:\n\nFor the record, in its annual sales press release dated 9 February 2023, LACROIX announced its intention to divest its Signalisation segment (8% of LACROIX' turnover) in order to focus its investments on its strategic markets around industrial IoT and electronic equipment.\n\nFollowing this announcement, the Signalisation BU embarked on a gradual process of empowerment in preparation for the sale.\n\nOn 14 December 2023, LACROIX Group announced that it had entered into exclusive negotiations with AIAC with a view to acquiring this BU.\n\n#### Other facts\n\nLACROIX GROUP has concluded a new loan agreement with LACROIX North America, dated on 7 June 2023. The loan amonts to \\$5,277K.\n\n### **3.2 Accounting principles and methods**\n\nFrench accounting regulations and methods have been applied in compliance with the prudence principle, in line with fundamental assumptions concerning:\n\n- business continuity,\n- consistency of accounting methods from one financial year to another,\n- independence of financial years,\n\nand in accordance with the general regulations on drawing up and presenting annual financial statements in keeping with the French Accounting Standards Authority (ANC) regulation no. 2016- 07 relating to French generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nThe basic method used to evaluate elements recorded in the accounts is the historical cost method.\n\n#### **Changes in accounting, evaluation, and estimation methods**\n\nNone\n\nThe main methods used are as follows:\n\n### **3.2.1 Intangible assets**\n\nIntangible assets are valued at their acquisition cost and are amortised using the straight-line method:\n\n- Concessions, patents, licenses, software - 1 to 10 years,\n- Research & Development costs 3 to 5 years.\n\n#### **3.2.2 Tangible assets**\n\nTangible assets are valued at their acquisition cost (purchase price and related expenses, other than expenses incurred in asset acquisition) or at their production cost. Interest on loans specific to asset production are not included in the cost of production of these assets.\n\nAmortisations are calculated using the straight-line method according to expected used full:\n\n- Installations and fittings 9 to 30 years,\n- Office IT equipment 3 to 6 years,\n- Furniture 15 years.\n\n#### **3.2.3 Financial assets**\n\nThe gross value of investment securities and other long-term investments corresponds to the purchase cost excluding related expenses. Receivables from investments and loans are valued at their historical cost.\n\nA provision for impairment is created where the value in use of investment securities is lower than the gross value. This value in use is assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking particular account of the general situation, business prospects, results of each of the companies concerned, and in line with the Group's development plans.\n\n{140}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **3.2.4 Receivables**\n\nReceivables are valued at their nominal value. A provision for impairment is created where the carrying value of investment securities is lower than the book value.\n\n#### **3.2.5 Short-term deposits**\n\nTheir gross value corresponds to the purchase cost excluding related expenses. Where the carrying value corresponding to the closing price is lower than the gross value, a provision for impairment is recorded at closing.\n\nStock options are recorded in the accounts as shortterm deposits.\n\n#### **3.2.6 Foreign currency transactions**\n\nForeign currency expenses and income are recorded at their counter value in the reference currency on the transaction date. Currency liabilities, receivables, and cash equivalents are shown on the balance sheet at their counter value at the end of the financial year.\n\nThe difference resulting from revaluation of currency liabilities and receivables at the latter rate is included in the balance sheet under \"Currency translation differences\". Unrealised exchange losses not compensated are included in a provision for other liabilities.\n\n#### **3.2.7 Provisions for other liabilities and charges**\n\nProvisions for other liabilities and charges are created to take account of the Company's obligations to third parties, which are likely or certain to cause a release of resources in favour of such third parties, without at least equivalent compensation, and for which the due date or amount is not precisely fixed. They are valued by taking account of the information available and, where applicable, after consultation with the Company's experts and advisers.\n\nThe amount recorded in respect of the provision for retirement has been valued using the actuarial method known as the \"accruals basis\" and also referred to as the \"retrospective method of projected credit units\". No differed tax asset was recorded in this respect.\n\nSince the closing of the 2013/2014 financial year, the Company has applied the ANC R 2013- 02 recommendation. The Company has opted for method no. 2, which allows actuarial differences to be treated using the corridor method. This method involves recording actuarial differences included in the corridor as off-sheet balance commitments and amortising in the results those outside the corridor.\n\n#### **3.2.8 Extraordinary income**\n\nExtraordinary income includes elements of income not related to the ordinary activities of the Company.\n\nIt also include elements which, while related to ordinary activities, are exceptional in terms of their amounts and their occurrence.\n\n#### **3.2.9 Taxes on profits**\n\nLACROIX Group (the Group's parent company) and its integrated subsidiaries (all over 95% owned) decided to adopt the tax group regime for groups provided for under Articles 223 A et seq. of the French General Tax Code (CGI), on the date of 27 September 1996, for 5 years as of 1 October 1996. Since 1 October 2001, the option of tax consolidation has been subject to renewal by tacit agreement.\n\nThe tax covered by subsidiaries is the tax they would have incurred in the absence of tax consolidation, the parent company recognising in profit or loss the provisional or definitive tax differentials arising from the application of the regime.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the tax scope includes the following entities:\n\n| List of subsidiaries        | Registered office   |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------|\n| LACROIX Electronics         | BEAUPREAU-EN-MAUGES

LACROIX GROUP**\n\nLACROIX is an international industrial and technological mid-cap business whose mission is to enable customers to build and run smarter life ecosystems thanks to connected technologies that are relevant, robust, and secure. Our ambition is to become a world leader in Industrial IoT and electronic devices for critical applications.\n\nAs a listed family business, we are able to combine the agility necessary to innovate in a constantly changing technological world with the long-term vision to invest in and build the future. We provide safe, connected equipment for the management and coordination of critical infrastructure such as intelligent road (street lighting, traffic management, road signs, and V2X) and water and energy facilities (smart grids and heating networks). We design, industrialise, and produce electronic equipment for our automotive, industry, home automation, aeronautics, and healthcare customers.\n\nEvery day, we work within our ecosystems alongside our customers and partners to create the link between the world of today and the world of tomorrow. We help them to build the industry of the future and to make the most of the opportunities for innovation that are all around us. We supply them with equipment and solutions for a smarter world.\n\n### **Consolidated income**\n\nOver the period, the company's business evolved as follows:\n\n- At 31 December 2023, revenue of €761.2M, with harmonious growth in our businesses (Electronics +7.6%, City +6.7%, Environment +8.1%);\n- Current EBITDA of €41.6M, with an improvement in City, Environment and Elec EMEA, but overall performance penalised by ELEC North America;\n- Operating profit of €3.8M impacted by significant non-recurring items: - €10M exceptional amortisation of the Customer List as a result of evolving OMC on the customer base of LACROIX Electronics MI (formerly Firstronics),\n\n- the consequences of the planned disposal of the Signalisation BU (sale of the building and treatment as an asset held for sale on the closing balance sheet),\n\n- The impact of the cyber attack (mainly the cost of rebuilding operational systems), which led to the temporary closure of 3 of our plants in May 2023 before a gradual restart;\n\n- An increase in financial expenses due to the fullyear impact of higher interest rates;\n- Net profit (Group share) was €4.3M, with the decline limited by the capitalisation of deferred tax on profitable entities and the recognition of minority interests;\n\nSignificantly positive free cash flow of €23.2M, benefiting in particular from an initial improvement in working capital requirements.\n\n{12}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Major events by activity**\n\n#### **Electronics Activity**\n\n#### **Connected technologies for smarter industries**\n\nOn the road to the industry of the future, this activity develops, industrialises, produces and integrates electronic assemblies and sub-assemblies for the automotive, aeronautics, home automation, industrial and health sectors. It assists its customers in creating innovations and developing the world of \"Smart Industries\".\n\nRepresenting more than 74% of revenue and more than 83% of the Group's workforce, this activity has enjoyed recurring and sustained growth over the last 10 years, enabling it to triple its sales during this period. The market, growing globally but also in Europe, also benefits from the 'nearshoring' trend. This trend towards relocation closer to the end markets is also supported by growing environmental concerns.\n\nIn this context, the major events of financial year 2023 were as follows:\n\n- Continued business growth (+7.6%), driven by the EMEA region and with a positive contribution from North America, albeit at a slower pace than anticipated.\n- Contrasting market segment dynamics, with strong automotive growth in Europe in the first half, followed by a slowdown in H2, a declining HBAS market throughout the period after years of strong growth post COVID, and strong growth in the industrial and aerospace segments, driven respectively by the introduction of new customers and the turnaround in the aerospace market after difficult years post COVID. In North America, the second half of the year was disrupted by strikes at US car-makers and by the ramp-up of new programmes, which took longer than expected.\n- •A gradual return to normal in the components markets (even if certain families may remain under pressure), with the impact of a reduction in one-off re-invoicing of excess supply costs, and also the gradual reduction in inventory levels.\n- Current EBITDA fell by 27% from €26.9M to €19.6M, with very different contributions from each geographical region. In EMEA, EBITDA has benefited from higher sales, reduced pressure on the components market and improved operating efficiency, leading to a significant improvement in EBITDA (+20%). Conversely, performance in North America was impacted by increases in payroll costs (inflation and appreciation of the Mexican peso), industrial disorganisation which penalised performance and operational control, leading to significant inventory discrepancies at the end of the period.\n- Current operating income of €1.9M, compared with €10.0M.\n- Net income fell sharply, with an exceptional write-off of USD 10M on the Firstronics Customer List, and higher financial expenses due to the full-year impact of rising interest rates.\n- A positive FCF, with better control of working capital requirements and the start of a reduction in inventories in line with the gradual normalisation of the components market.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of more uncertain end-market dynamics (automotive, HBAS), business is likely to mark a pause in the sustained growth of recent years, although the programmes won should continue to fuel growth at certain sites. Current operating profitability should also rise, thanks in particular to the vigorous action plan implemented to turn performance around in North America.\n\nThe key figures for the Electronics Activity are as follows (contribution):\n\n| In €M                    | N<br>(12 months) | N - 1<br>(12 months) |\n|--------------------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| Revenue                  | 562.1            | 522.2                |\n| Current EBITDA           | 19.6             | 26.9                 |\n| Current operating profit | 1.9              | 10.0                 |\n| Net income               | (17.4)           | (0.2)                |\n| Cash flow                | 7.7              | 14.7                 |\n| Investments*             | xxx              | 15.9                 |\n\n(\\*) Net investments excluding investments relating to M&A operations.\n\n{13}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Environment Activity**\n\n#### **Connected technologies for smarter water & energies**\n\nThe scarcity of water and energy resources is one of the biggest global concerns. Optimising their use is a priority and controlling the impact of human activities on the environment is a fundamental need for any company with a committed CSR policy. By designing and producing equipment to control, automate and remotely manage water and energy infrastructures, LACROIX Environment has chosen \"Smart Water & Energy\", at a time of digital revolution and connected objects, to optimise the use of water and energy resources.\n\nExperiencing constant growth (its sales have doubled in under 10 years), and with the acquisition of SAE IT-systems, which has an equivalent offer in electricity networks, this activity accounts for 11% of Group revenue and contributes significantly to profits.\n\nEvolving in buoyant markets worldwide, with the challenges and the maturity of the water and energy markets creating a context that favours smart, connected equipment, the Environment Activity pursues investments in HR and Research & Development (R&D) to accelerate its international development, where it currently achieves around 25% of its sales.\n\nIn this context, the major events of the financial year were as follows:\n\n- Another year of dynamic growth in revenue (+8.1% in 2023 after +9.1% in 2022) to €82.6M, with the Water France, Water International and Smart Grids segments all contributing to this performance, and with a steady HVAC segment).\n- Accelerating international development in target areas, notably Saudi Arabia, where the company achieved revenue in excess of €3.0M in 2023, benefiting from investments aimed at improving the efficiency of water management services.\n- Current EBITDA of €17.9M, confirming the target of over 20%\n- COI remaining at high levels at €16.3M, despite continued investments in R&D (expensed) and HR to support and reinforce growth.\n\nThe activity's outlook is favourable, with momentum remaining positive. Results will remain excellent.\n\nThe key figures for the Environment Activity are as follows (contribution):\n\n| In €M                    | N<br>(12 months) | N - 1<br>(12 months) |\n|--------------------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| Revenue                  | 82.6             | 76.4                 |\n| Current EBITDA           | 17.9             | 16.5                 |\n| Current operating profit | 16.3             | 14.9                 |\n| Net income               | 11.9             | 9.9                  |\n| Cash flow                | 12.7             | 10.8                 |\n| Investments*             | xx               | 1.1                  |\n\n(\\*) Net investments excluding investments relating to M&A operations.\n\n### **City Activity**\n\n#### **Connected technologies for smarter mobility**\n\nBy designing and producing equipment for the management of intelligent road infrastructures based on four areas of expertise: road signs, traffic management and regulation, street lighting and V2X, LACROIX City directs, enhances and secures the flows of traffic and people, demonstrating its commitment to \"Smart Mobility\".\n\nLACROIX City addresses this market, which it knows well, and promotes its transformation through the adoption and mastery of technologies. For decades, LACROIX City has been meeting the needs of a changing world that is becoming more and more urban and connected, while supporting communities and businesses with equipment used for smart roads. Its expertise and experience provide a solid foundation for imagining and designing tomorrow's connected technologies.\n\nThe major events of the 2023 financial year were as follows:\n\n- Revenue up to €116.4M, from €109.1M in 2022, with growth across all segments.\n- Continued strong growth in the public lighting segment (+15%), driven by the structurally favourable winds of smart public lighting and supported by the performance of contracts signed internationally, notably in Flanders.\n- Signalisation and Traffic activities recovering to +6.9% and 3.6% vs. -9% and -8%, with a favourable effect from the performance of contracts in Morocco for Traffic and a favourable effect from price revisions in the Signalisation segment. For the record, price increases are passed on through the application of price adjustment formulas, which are applied on the anniversary date.\n- Recurring EBITDA up sharply to €4.3M (vs. +€0.9M in 2022), also an improvement on 2021 (€1.0M). This upward trend was driven in particular by price adjustments in a context of raw material prices returning to more normal levels over the period\n- An improvement in current operating income to a profit of €0.9M, compared with a loss of €2.5M in 2022.\n\n{14}------------------------------------------------\n\n• Net income of €1.8M, impacted by items relating to the ongoing disposal of the Signalisation segment (net capital gain on the disposal of the building, capital loss arising from its treatment as an asset held for sale at 31 December).\n\nThe City business should see the sale of the Signalisation segment completed during the next financial year. On a like-for-like basis (excluding Signalisation), business should continue to grow. Margins will be impacted from time to time by the end of the absorption of structural costs by the Signalisation segment.\n\nThe key figures for the City Activity are as follows (contribution):\n\n| In €M                    | N<br>(12 months) | N - 1<br>(12 months) |\n|--------------------------|------------------|----------------------|\n| Revenue                  | 116.4            | 109.1                |\n| Current EBITDA           | 4.3              | 0.9                  |\n| Current operating profit | 0.9              | (2.5)                |\n| Net income               | (1.8)            | (4.3)                |\n| Cash flow                | 1.2              | (1.9)                |\n| Investments*             | xx               | 1.5                  |\n\n(\\*) Net investments excluding investments relating to M&A operations and financial assets.\n\n## **Research & Development Activity**\n\nR&D activities concern all activities and are recognised as operating expenses. In 2023, these activities generated €3.6M of Research Tax Credit (CIR) in the 2023 accounts.\n\nFor the record, in 2021 LACROIX was selected to take part in 3 collaborative and innovative projects, two of which are winners of the \"relocation in critical sectors\" tender, under the France Relance (Relaunching France) plan. For the period 2021- 2024, the projects in question address themes such as urban mobility and its impact on air quality, or better management of critical resources such as water. These projects give rise to the recognition of operating subsidies (partial financing of R&D work).\n\n### **Financial situation**\n\nCFFO (cash flows from operations) totalled €34.1M compared to €33.0M in the previous year.\n\nOver the period, the change in working capital requirements made a positive contribution (+€8.9M) despite the dynamic growth in revenue, confirming the start of the expected improvement after two years of deterioration due to pressure on supplies in the components market.\n\nCapital expenditure (excluding financial expenses) was contained at €16.9M (2.2% of revenue). In addition, LACROIX completed asset disposals totalling €3.7M, primarily the disposal of the Signalisation BU's main building.\n\nAs a result, Free Cash Flow was positive at +€23.2M compared to -16.9 €M\n\nIn addition, the following special features should be noted:\n\n- Treatment as an asset available for sale led to the deconsolidation of a debt of around €5M\n- New borrowings totalling €33.9M, including €10M for an 8-year recovery participating loan (PPR) with a 4-year grace period\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group's net debt (excluding rent and acquisition debt) totalled €112.9M compared with €138.8M. Positive cash flow amounted to €42.5M on the closing date. The ratio of net debts (excluding debts for rentals and acquisitions) to equity (gearing) amounts to 0.59 compared to 0.72 as at 31 December 2022.\n\n#### **Prospects**\n\nFollowing a year marked by solid business growth and resilient profitability, LACROIX expects 2024 to be a year of contrasts depending on its markets.\n\nTaking into account the economic uncertainties of 2024, LACROIX expects sales excluding signage to exceed €710 million in 2024, slightly up on its 2023 level excluding signage (i.e. €702 million). The recurring EBITDA margin is expected to exceed its 2023 level, within a range of 5.5% to 6.5%.\n\nBy 2025, the Group confirms its sales target of €800 million, conditional on the completion of an external growth operation and more favorable demand trends in the automotive and HBAS markets. An EBITDA margin of around 9% remains the target, but realistically this seems difficult to achieve as early as 2025. Nevertheless, LACROIX remains fully confident in its ability to reach this new milestone in the medium term.\n\n{15}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **LACROIX Group**\n\n### **Company activity**\n\nAs the parent company of the Group, it is responsible for the management of assets, mainly comprising the equity of the parent companies of the three activities and some subsidiaries, and supervises and coordinates each of them through General Management and Executive Management, as well as Finance, Legal & Compliance, Human Resources, Strategic Innovation, R&D, IT, and Communication Departments.\n\nLACROIX Group also shares a certain number of resources between activities, such as the teams in the Payroll shared-service centre, the managers of cross-cutting projects (IT, Finance, HR, etc.), and the central R&D teams working on the common platforms of our future offers.\n\nRevenue, excluding dividends, is generated by royalties received from subsidiaries in exchange for the services described above.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, revenue totalled €13,291K, compared with €13,173K in the prior period, reflecting the stability of the scope of services provided for Group companies.\n\nOperating income fell to -€1,835K compared to -€934K. This change is due in particular to the base effect, which involved the vacancy of certain posts leading to a one-off reduction in operating expenses.\n\nThis loss was largely offset by the positive net financial income of +€14,996K compared with +€11,911K, and the income tax benefit of €4,056K compared with €3,598K relating to the integrated profits system.\n\nAs such, net income was €17,206K compared to €14,518K for the previous financial year.\n\n#### **Non tax-deductible expenses**\n\nNon tax-deductible expenses and charges at the end of the year amounted to a total of €40,826.\n\nThis amount corresponds to the non-deductible portion of the lease payments on the cars used by the Company for an amount of €32,890 and to corporate vehicle tax (TVS) charges of €7,936, which generated a tax charge of 10,207 euros.\n\n### **Information on payment terms**\n\nIn accordance with Articles L. 441-6-1 and D. 441-4 of the French Commercial Code, we hereby inform you that at the end of the financial year, the balance of trade receivables and payables by due date was as follows:\n\n|                                                                                            | Received

MAIN RISK FACTORS FACED BY THE COMPANY**\n\nUnder the provisions of Article L. 225-100-1, I 3 of the French Commercial Code, we present the relevant information:\n\n### **Strategic and operational risks**\n\nThe nature of the strategic risks to which the Company is exposed is unlikely to seriously jeopardise the sustainability of Group activities.\n\nIn view of its activities, the Group is nevertheless exposed to the following operational risks:\n\n#### **Risks relating to raw materials and shortage of electronic components**\n\nRaw materials account for a large proportion of the purchases made by the Group, and a significant share of its revenue. They account for over 70% of revenue, and raw materials account for over 85% of its purchases. This is particularly true in the Electronics Activity, where purchases account for close to 70% of revenue. The Group is exposed both to their price fluctuations and their availability on the market. Any sustained increase in purchase prices and/or variability in the availability of inputs could jeopardise the economic balance of the contracts and harm the Group's business by increasing its costs and reducing its profitability\n\nThe Group's contracts generally include price indexing mechanisms linked to changes in the cost of inputs. This is the case, notably, for the City Activity, which has price review clauses in its multi-annual contracts with local authorities. This is also mainly the case for the Electronics Activity, where some component prices are even under customer control, enabling both upward and downward price changes to be passed on. These mechanisms do not always cover all costs, as sometimes there is a time lag between the rise in input prices and the rise being passed on to the selling price, but they do help greatly mitigate the impact.\n\nTo better mitigate such impacts, the Group may also be led to hedge certain raw materials (aluminium, tin, etc.) with suppliers or on the markets.\n\n{19}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **IT system risk**\n\nGroup Management pays particular attention to its IT system and a series of provisions has been implemented to ensure its security and availability. This involves regularly updating the Group's solutions, its technical architecture, and its security architecture. The regular completion of audits and intrusion tests, carried out by third-party experts, contributes to this continuous improvement. Furthermore, in order to reduce any major risks, crisis management plans have been implemented in each of the 3 business sectors and have been audited over the year.\n\n#### **Risks relating to matching the Group's offer to the expectations of its customers, and to the development of new products**\n\nThe Group's growth relies partly on its ability to integrate new technologies into its products in order to offer optimal performance to its customers in line with their practices. More broadly, it is essential for the Company to anticipate the needs and practices of its customers in order to develop the products and technologies appropriate to their requirements. In this context, the Group devotes a significant proportion of its expenditure and staff to its research and development activity in order to develop new products, services and technologies existing products, and where necessary improve existing ones. The quality and success of the Group's research and development are key to its commercial success.\n\nIn order to limit this risk in a context of accelerating R&D expenditure, LACROIX has i) strengthened its innovation capacity by creating the LACROIX Lab, teams in charge of experimenting with uses and technologies, in contact with the Group's customers in order to monitor and anticipate changing needs; ii) created the key account management function in order to strengthen proximity with strategic customers; iii) strengthened the marketing teams throughout the 2016-2020 plan, thus enabling better market monitoring and, above all, better definition/ specification of customer needs; iv) strengthened the R&D teams for better control of technologies and the implementation schedule in our new offerings (the right product at the right time), and; v) set up a process between the marketing and R&D teams to ensure consistency between market needs and development choices/priorities.\n\n#### **Industrial and environmental risks**\n\nThe significant scale of the Company's industrial investment programmes ensures that it has recent and secure equipment to mitigate the risks of major failures that might bring manufacturing operations to a halt. Therefore, the main industrial risks are those that could affect or stop production at the main sites (fire, technical breakdown, etc.) and compromise the quality of products. Quality procedures are in place for identifying, correcting, and preventing, or at least mitigating, failures.\n\n#### **Legal, tax, and social risks**\n\nThe Group monitors legal, tax, and social developments in order to ensure that its operations are compliant, and to anticipate the impacts of new regulations. A review of the main risks is performed per business sector in order to ensure that all risks are exhaustively considered in the financial statements.\n\nBased on known information, the Group considers it unlikely that current mutual agreement procedures or disputes will have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n### **Financial risks**\n\nThe different degrees to which the Group is exposed to financial risks are set out below.\n\n#### **Currency risk**\n\nOther than the Electronics Activity, the Group is not exposed to currency risks.\n\nIn the Electronics business, the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk, mainly with regard to component purchases, which are often made in USD or JPY, as well as other payroll costs and/or service purchases invoiced in TND, MXN and PLN.\n\nAs regards purchases in USD and JPY, the Company has contracts with its main customers enabling it to adjust the selling price of products according to changes in the EUR/USD exchange rate. Therefore, the currency risk for this item is under control. For the balance, the Company uses partial hedging of its needs to cover a target rate set each fiscal year. Purchases in USD and JPY represent approximately €90 million annually, 80% of which is passed on to customers through contracts. For the remaining part, exchange rate hedging is carried out to secure a \"budget\" rate.\n\nExpenditure in TND, MXN and PLN (around €70 million) mainly concerns salaries and social charges for employees at the Tunisian, Mexican and Polish sites, and some local purchases. The Group's policy is to carry out forward hedging on the basis of forecast requirements, enabling a \"budget\" rate to be covered (one-year horizon). Changes in labour costs are also factored into the new commercial offers.\n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\nGenerally speaking, the use of financial instruments is limited strictly to business requirements, and excludes any speculative activities.\n\n#### **Interest rate risk**\n\nA significant proportion of the Group's debt is at variable rates.\n\nThe Group implements various financial instruments of varying maturities to mitigate this risk. At the end of December 2022, the portion of financing at variable rates hedged by swaps was 29% of the nominal value.\n\n#### **Liquidity risk**\n\nGross debt position for the Group amounts to €163,048K.\n\nAvailable cash amounts to €22,613K. The Group therefore considers its exposure to this risk to be low.\n\n#### **Counterparty risk**\n\nCounterparty risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group in the event that a customer defaults on its contractual obligations.\n\nCustomer profiles by sector of activity are described below:\n\n| Activities             | Types of<br>main clients                                                                   |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| LACROIX<br>City        | Authorities and private<br>companies operating road<br>infrastructures                     |\n| LACROIX<br>Environment | Public bodies and major<br>water, heating and energy<br>network management<br>stakeholders |\n| LACROIX<br>Electronics | French and foreign<br>companies operating<br>internationally                               |\n\nThus, customer typology itself is a limiting factor in this risk.\n\nIn addition, each of the Group's activities has implemented a system for monitoring and managing customer risk, sometimes using credit insurance contracts for this purpose to protect from potential customer risk.\n\n## **POST-CLOSING EVENTS**\n\nIn its annual sales press release dated 9 February 2023, LACROIX announced its intention to divest its Road Signs segment (8% of LACROIX' turnover) in order to focus its investments on its strategic markets around industrial IoT and electronic equipment. This historic segment holds a leading position in road signs, particularly in France where it has a 25% market share, enjoying a very strong reputation among local authorities and road operators.\n\nHowever, in view of the evolution of the markets addressed, the technological and commercial synergies between the Road Signs segment and the two other market segments addressed by LACROIX's City activity, Street Lighting and Traffic Management, are too limited.\n\nParticular attention will be paid to the industrial and social plans of the potential buyers of this business segment, so that it can benefit from the resources it needs for its continued development.\n\nThe scope of the proposed sale represents revenue of €55 million and involves 315 employees through the Saint-Herblain industrial site (260 people), three distribution subsidiaries (Reunion, Mayotte and New Caledonia), and a facility in Spain.\n\n## **STOCK MARKET INFORMATION**\n\n## **Changes in share price over the 2023 financial year**\n\nThe LACROIX Group share is listed on Euronext Paris (compartment B).\n\nOver the course of financial year 2023, 706,784 shares were traded for a capital amount of €22,657,759 at an average price of €32.23.\n\nThe share price as at closing on 31 December 2023 was €29.50.\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Company purchases of treasury shares**\n\n#### **Share buy-back programme**\n\nOur proposition is to renew the powers given by the General Meeting on 11 May 2023 to the Board of Directors to purchase Company shares on the stock market, under the conditions and within the limits specified in Articles L. 22-10-62 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, and pursuant to the provisions of European Regulation no. 2273/2003 of 22 December 2003.\n\nThe aims of the buy-back programme are identical to those for the previous financial year:\n\n- to ensure market-making under a liquidity contract compliant with AFEI's code of ethics recognised by the Financial Markets Authority,\n- to purchase shares for retention and subsequent allocation for trade or payment as part of an external growth operation,\n- to ensure coverage of plans to allocate bonus shares or share purchase options, and more generally all shareholding plans for employees and corporate officers of the Group,\n- to enable cancellation of all or part of the shares bought back.\n\nAuthorisation is granted for a maximum term of 18 months subject to the following conditions:\n\n- the maximum number of redeemable shares may not exceed 335,016, i.e. 6.94% of share capital.\n- the maximum purchase price per share is set at €60.\n- the total amount earmarked for this programme is set at €20,102,520.\n\nThe shares will be bought back through trading on the market or through block share acquisitions as per the applicable laws and regulations. Block share acquisitions could account for the entire programme. Acquisitions and disposals can be made during a public offering within the limits permitted by stock market regulations.\n\nThe number of shares held under execution of the scheme may not exceed 10% of share capital, i.e. 482,909 shares.\n\n#### **Assessment of previous share buy-back programmes**\n\nUnder the programmes authorised by the General Meetings of 11 May 2021 and 6 May 2022, applying to the financial year ending 31 December 2023, the Company made the following transactions in its own shares: sale of 2,091 shares to cover bonus share allotment plans or stock option plans and, more generally, all shareholding plans for the Group's employees and officers.\n\nIn addition, under the liquidity agreement held 100% by LACROIX Group:\n\n- 12,813 shares were acquired at an average price of €32.43;\n- 12,612 shares were sold at an average price of €32.72.\n\nAt the end of the financial year, the shares held under the buy-back programme were allocated to the following objectives:\n\n- coverage of stock option plans for employees and corporate officers of LACROIX Group: 61,470 shares,\n- subsequent allocation for trade or payment as part of an external growth operation: 80,334 shares,\n- stabilisation of the price by a service provider: 4,199 shares,\n\ni.e. a total of 146,003 treasury shares representing 3.02% of the capital, having a book value of €2,812,060 and a market value of €4,350,889 based on the price on 31 December 2023.\n\n## **REGULATED AGREEMENTS**\n\n### **New agreements**\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Article L. 225-38 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, any agreement entered into directly or through an intermediary between the Company and its Chief Executive Officer, one of its Deputy Chief Executive Officers, one of its directors, one of its shareholders holding more than 10% of the voting rights or, in the case of a shareholder company, the company controlling it as defined by Article L. 233-3 of the said code, is subject to prior authorisation by the Board of Directors and is the subject of a special report by the auditor with a view to ratification by the General Meeting: In 2022, the following new agreement was concluded:\n\n### **Loan agreement with LACROIX North America**\n\nPersons concerned: Nicolas Bedouin (Chief Operating Officer of LACROIX Group and Chair of LACROIX North America on the date of signing of the agreement).\n\nNature and purpose: Conclusion of a loan agreement between the Company and LACROIX North America, dated 8 June 2023.\n\nAmount: The amount of the loan is USD 5,277,463, with an interest rate of 8%.\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Previous agreements that continued during the year**\n\nIn accordance with legal requirements, the Board of Directors examined the previous agreements that were still in force:\n\n#### **Provision of services agreement with VINILA INVESTISSEMENTS**\n\nPersons concerned: Vincent Bedouin (Chair & CEO of LACROIX Group and Chair of VINILA INVESTISSEMENTS), Nicolas Bedouin (Chief Operating Officer of LACROIX Group and member of the Supervisory Board of VINILA INVESTISSEMENTS), and Marie-Reine Bedouin (member of the Board of Directors of LACROIX Group and Chair of the Supervisory Board of VINILA INVESTISSEMENTS).\n\nNature and purpose: Conclusion of a provision of services agreement on 4 January 2021, ratified by the general meeting of 6 May 2022, whereby VINILA INVESTISSEMENTS undertakes to make available to the Company premises situated at 5 rue de la Pérouse, 75016 Paris, France.\n\nAmount: The amount of the annual flat compensation paid in return for the provision of service comes to €20,000 excl.

With regard to the adoption of the principles set out in the Middlenext Code, the Board of Directors has taken due note of the \"points to be watched\" mentioned therein, has considered the issues arising from them and has confirmed that the Company is committed to respecting each of these points. This management report also details below the Company's compliance with the recommendations of the Middlenext Code, and where applicable explains the reasons why some of them could not be implemented at the date of this management report.\n\nAccordingly, in accordance with Article L.22-10-10-4 of the French Commercial Code, the Company mentions below the recommendations that have been rejected and the reasons why they were rejected:\n\n- R1 members of the Board of Directors attend the General Assembly: Since minority shareholders hardly ever attend general meetings, the mandatory attendance of directors is not justified.\n- R2 entrusting services other than certifying financial statements to a firm other than the auditor's: as the value of such services remains low in relation to their volume of business, with reasonable service amounts, the independence of the auditors is not called into question.\n- R5 three-year training plan for directors: The board of directors is constituted on the basis of their past training and experience, which they continue to acquire during their term of office. The implementation of a training plan must provide real added value, and will therefore be the subject of further reflection.\n- R7 the chairmanship of the specialised committees is entrusted to independent members, except in very special cases for which reasons are given: Vincent Bedouin, as Chair and CEO of the Group, is best placed to chair the strategic committee.\n- R9 and R17 putting in place a succession plan for the leader and key people: This point requires further reflection before it is formalised.\n- R11 staggered renewals of terms of office for Board members: Staggered renewals of terms of office are no longer in place since the switch to the one-tier mode. A reflection on this point will be undertaken on the arrival of a new director.\n\n### **Composition and operation of the administrative and management bodies**\n\n#### **Composition and operation of the Board of Directors**\n\nThe Board of Directors is the collegiate body that determines the Company's policies and ensures their implementation, defines the Company's strategy, appoints the corporate officers and, through its deliberations, regulates any questions concerning the proper running of the Company in accordance with the powers conferred by the law, the Articles of Association, and the Board of Directors' internal regulations.\n\nThe Board of Directors is composed of at least three (3) members and at most eighteen (18) members, to which the representatives of the named employees may be added.\n\nThe number of directors over the age of 70 cannot exceed one third of the Board of Directors in office.\n\nThe term of office for each director is three (3) years.\n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\n| On 31 December 2023, the Board of Directors of LACROIX Group comprised 7 members: |

Board of Directors**\n\nTaking into account the criteria recommended by the Middlenext Code for qualifying a director as independent, it appears from the examination of the situation of each director that Mr Hugues Meili, Ms Ariane Malbat, Mrs Muriel Barneoud and Mr Pierre Tier all meet the conditions for qualifying as independent.\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Representativeness of women on the Board of Directors**\n\nIn accordance with Articles L. 225-18-1 and L. 22-10- 3 of the French Commercial Code on the balanced representation of women and men on Boards of Directors and on professional equality, we hereby inform you that the male/female distribution within the Company's Board of Directors is 57% to 43% as of 31 December 2023.\n\nThere are 3 female members out of a total of 7 members currently on the Board of Directors.\n\n#### **Mission of the Chair of the Board of Directors**\n\nThe Chair of the Board of Directors organises and directs the work of the Board of Directors, which he reports to the General Meeting of shareholders of the Company.\n\nThe Chair of the Board of Directors ensures the proper functioning of the Company's corporate bodies, including the committees under the Board of Directors.\n\n#### **Information for directors**\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors have received all the documents and information they need to carry out their duties within the time needed for their examination.\n\nThe Chair has regularly provided the directors with all relevant information concerning the Company.\n\n#### **Rules of procedure of the Board of Directors**\n\nOn 26 July 2018, the Board of Directors adopted the rules of procedure allowing it to meet by videoconference or telecommunications, and updated them on 16 December 2019, 19 September 2022 and 20 March 2023.\n\nThese rules also define the Board of Directors' operating rules regarding ethics (share ownership, non-disclosure, conflict of interest, etc.).\n\n#### **Work of the Board of Directors**\n\nThe Board of Directors meets as often as the interests of the Company require. The work is organised through committees.\n\nDuring the year ending 31 December 2023, the following 11 meetings were held:\n\n- Four meetings of the Board of Directors, with an attendance rate of 92,86%, in order to:\n\t- Consider the annual and half-year financial statements,\n\t\t- Set up a CSR committee.\n- Two meetings of the Audit and Compliance Committee\n- Two meetings of the Development Committee\n- Two meetings of the Compensation Committee\n- Three meetings of the CSR Committee\n- A meeting of the strategic committee\n\n#### **Specialised committees of the Board of Directors**\n\nThe Board of Directors has established 5 permanent Committees:\n\n- an audit & compliance committee\n- a compensation committee\n- a strategic committee\n- a development committee\n- a CSR committee\n\nThe mission of which is to provide in-depth analysis and reflection prior to the Board of Directors' deliberations and to contribute to the preparation of the Board's decisions.\n\n## **Audit & Compliance Committee**\n\nThe audit & compliance committee, acting under the responsibility of the Board of Directors, is primarily responsible for reviewing the accounts and monitoring issues relating to the preparation and control of accounting and financial information. It also oversees the definition and monitoring of the Company's compliance programme. It follows the process of preparing financial information and, where appropriate, makes recommendations to ensure its integrity.\n\nAs such, it is responsible for:\n\n- following the process of preparing financial information;\n- monitoring the effectiveness of the internal audit and risk management systems, and the effectiveness of the compliance programme;\n- issuing recommendations on the Statutory Auditors proposed at the General Meeting;\n- monitoring the Statutory Auditors' performance of their tasks;\n- monitoring the Statutory Auditors' compliance with the conditions of independence;\n- approving services other than account certification (SACC);\n- reporting to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Audit & Compliance Committee must inform the Board of Directors immediately of any difficulties encountered. These reports are either inserted in the minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors concerned, or attached as an appendix to these minutes.\n\nThe Audit & Compliance Committee is composed

Directors sign an annual declaration attesting that they had no conflicts of interest during the past financial year.

The Board of Directors may also carry out any investigation in the event of reasonable doubt, and may if necessary call in an independent expert.\n\n#### **Main features of internal control and risk management procedures**\n\nThis report on the internal control and risk management procedures implemented within LACROIX Group is based on the implementation guide for the reference framework published by the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority) and applicable to mid-cap and small-cap stocks of financial markets. The objectives of internal control at LACROIX Group can be achieved thanks to the environment created within the Group, as well as the specific organisation put in place, from which specific internal audits and risk management procedures stem. All of these points are presented below.\n\n#### **Internal control objectives and stakeholders**\n\nInternal control, as it is deployed within LACROIX Group, contributes to the prevention and control of risks arising from the Company's business, including risks relating to errors and fraud. In particular, it ensures:\n\n- Compliance with applicable laws and regulations;\n- Reliability of financial statements;\n- Safeguarding and protection of assets;\n- Prevention and management of risks, and the implementation of process optimisations.\n\nLike any monitoring system, the internal control system cannot provide an absolute guarantee that all the risks of error and fraud are totally eliminated.\n\nNaturally, these objectives can only be achieved through appropriation and application of the rules and procedures by all the Company's staff, under the supervision of each head of department. LACROIX Group centralises the management of its internal control, supported by the **Legal & Compliance** department for some aspects and the **Audit & Internal control** department for others.  \n\nThe Audit & Compliance Committee aims monitors and challenges the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management system.\n\n#### **Internal control environment**\n\nA number of structural standards for internal control exist within LACROIX Group.   \n\nOur **Values** - audacity, commitment, team spirit, openness, and respect – are therefore points of reference that unite our internal teams. They guide conduct, encourage initiatives, and give responsibility in a positive way. In addition, the **Ethical Charter** sets out the ethical principles applicable at LACROIX Group for conducting business and individual behaviour. It does not claim to address all questions of an ethical nature, but rather sets out the basic rules and guidelines that must govern each decision. It provides the framework for the **Anti-Corruption Code of Conduct** and the **Competitiveness Code of Conduct**: these compliance programmes contribute to employee awareness and training, and make it possible to implement appropriate mechanisms for the prevention of offences, and their detection and punishment where appropriate.\n\nThe **Opportunities & Threats Matrix** is based on the strategic plan, and its priorities are reviewed by the Executive Committee every year. This matrix identifies subjects having the greatest impact and the most important levers for sustainable growth at LACROIX Group. This matrix is part of the multi-year development plan defined by the Management.\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, the **Operating Rules** between LACROIX Group and each of the activities define the levels of responsibility borne by the various players, as well as their areas of responsibility. These rules are supported by **delegations of authority**, enabling responsibility to be devolved to those with specific skills, authority, and the necessary means.\n\n#### **Organisation of internal control**\n\nInternal control is everyone's responsibility. In particular, all process leaders are responsible for ensuring the existence and application of procedures within their scope and for ensuring the associated regulatory monitoring. Nevertheless, an organisation as well as control, monitoring and steering tools exist, giving Management the keys to decision-making on the one hand, and ensuring handover of internal control at all levels within LACROIX Group on the other. The main factors are described below:\n\n- **• The Management Controller Managers** of activities oversee reports to General Management. In particular, they allow monthly monitoring of budget commitments by subsidiary, by segment or both, and also include non-financial elements and forecasts, ensuring better management of subsidiaries.\n- Likewise, **cash reporting** centralised at the head office ensures weekly monitoring of cash flows and the debt position of subsidiaries and consolidated debt.\n- **• The chief accountants** are responsible for the reliability of financial reporting, and more particularly for due observance of the Group's procedures. The tax returns of the LACROIX Group's French subsidiaries are prepared or checked by the central Accounting Department. These tax returns are also regularly reviewed by external consultants.\n- **• The consolidation department** is centralised at headquarters. It prepares the accounts in accordance with IFRS and ensures the consistency of processing operations and their compliance with Group rules and procedures.\n- **• The Legal & Compliance Department** ensures overall regulatory compliance (company law, contracts, insurance, compliance, etc.) and supports activities in the context of major contractual negotiations or litigation management. It advises the General Management and intervenes in internal restructuring and external growth operations. Advice can be obtained from outside experts on an ad hoc basis. **Compliance advisers** are in place within each of the activities. They act as relays for the Legal & Compliance Department, working alongside the teams to communicate rules and procedures, and are easily available to answer any ethical questions asked by staff.\n\n**• The Information System Department** notably ensures the integrity and safeguarding of data, as well as the security and availability of our IT systems. As such, external intrusion audits and IT disaster recovery tests are regularly conducted under the supervision of the IT Department and the CISO (Chief IT Security Officer). All the LACROIX Group's major subsidiaries use **ERP**software.\n\n#### **Implementation of internal control**\n\nThe Audit & Internal control department plans its duties on the basis of approved priorities in the Opportunities & Threats Matrix. It also relies on the recommendations of our statutory auditors on internal control and IT configuration. From this perspective, its duties revolve around:\n\n- Monitoring compliance with the law and with internal rules;\n- Improving operational processes;\n- Continuous improvement of internal control and the fight against fraud;\n- Support provided to the Legal & Compliance Department.\n\n#### **Main activities in financial year 2023**\n\nFor the 2023 fiscal year, the following tasks were carried out:\n\n• Continuous improvement of internal control and the fight against fraud: • Deployment of the automated control solution on the Electronics activity of the LACROIX group,\n\n• Updating Opportunities & Threats Matrix and redefining priorities,\n\n• Continuation of campaigns for awareness raising and combating external fraud,\n\n• Review of the segregation of duties implemented in our ERP software,\n\n• Continuous securing of our information systems.\n\n• Internal auditing of subsidiaries: • 14 subsidiaries were audited on key procedures: the various cycles are reviewed to ensure proper application of accounting rules and methods, thereby ensuring the reliability of financial reporting. Several compliance issues are\n\nalso included in these audits. - Follow-up of action plans further to previous audits for 7 subsidiaries in 2023.\n\n• Operational audits:\n\n• Monitoring proper replenishment of strategic stocks,\n\n• Checking the correct application of our marketing/R&D process on new products.\n\n• Support provided to the Compliance Department: • Our mapping of corruption risks was updated\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Areas of focus for 2024**\n\nThe areas of focus defined for 2024 will mainly concern:\n\n- Continuous improvement of internal control and the fight against fraud:\n\t- Deployment of additional automated controls\n\t- on the Electronics activity of the LACROIX group, • Continuation of campaigns for awareness\n\t- raising and combating external fraud, • Review of the segregation of duties\n\t- implemented in our ERP software,\n\t- Continuous securing of our information systems,\n\t- Monitoring the proper implementation of business continuity plans in our main subsidiaries.\n- Internal auditing of subsidiaries:\n\t- 15 subsidiaries are to be audited during the year,\n\n• From 2024, the action plans will be monitored every six months to ensure that all the recommendations made by the Internal Audit Department are implemented.\n\n#### • Operational audits:\n\n• Level-3 controls on the entire SAPIN 2 anticorruption system;\n\n- Audit of the Cyber risk management system. • Internal audit intervention during an annual physical inventory to identify possible\n- improvements in its preparation\n- Support provided to the Compliance Department • Updating corruption scenarios and associated security action plans.\n\n#### **Factors likely to have an impact in the event of a takeover**\n\nFactors likely to have an impact in the event of a takeover are disclosed in the Management Report.\n\n#### **Shareholder attendance at the General Meeting**\n\nSpecial arrangements concerning shareholder attendance at the General Meeting are described in Articles 22 and 23 of the Company's Articles of Association. Additionally, some of these conditions, together with practical information, are contained in the meeting notices and invitations published and/or sent to shareholders before each meeting.\n\n#### **Diversity and equity policy within the company**\n\nThe Group is committed to achieving gender balance and equity at all hierarchical levels. The policy and related achievements are described in the Non-Financial Performance Statement.\n\n## **COMPANY**\n\n## **ADMINISTRATION AND CONTROL**\n\nAs all the directorships of the members of the Board of Directors expire at this General Meeting, it is proposed that the General Meeting:\n\n- Renew the directorships of:\n\t- Mrs Murielle Barneoud\n\t- Mr Vincent Bedouin\n\t- Mr Hubert de Boisredon\n\t- Mr Ariane Malbat\n\t- Mr Hugues Meili\n\t- Mr Pierre Tiers\n- Appoint Mrs Christine Lioret as director, replacing Mrs Marie-Reine Bedouin, whose term of office is not renewed, for a term of three (3) years expiring at the end of the Ordinary General Meeting of shareholders to be held in 2027 to approve the financial statements for the year then ended.\n\nThe engagements of the Statutory Auditors have not expired.\n\n## **APPROPRIATION OF**\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **PROFIT**\n\nWe suggest that you approve the appropriation of the financial year's net profit of €17,089,706.60, plus retained earnings of €1,519,389.35, as follows:\n\n| Profit from the financial year                             | 17,089,706.60 euros |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Plus retained earnings                                     | 1,519,389.35 euros  |\n| Making a distributable profit of                           | 18,609,095.95 euros |\n| As dividends to shareholders<br>Namely €0.80 per share     | 3,863,276.80 euros  |\n| To the \"Other reserves\" account<br>which thus totals €95M. | 11,000,000.00 euros |\n| The balance in \"Retained earnings\"                         | 1,401,462.15 euros  |\n\nOn the understanding that this amount shall be increased by the fraction of the dividends corresponding to shares held by the Company as part of its share buy-back programme.\n\nFollowing this appropriation, shareholders' equity stands at €171,428,205.17 before the portion of dividends on the treasury shares held by the Company.\n\nSince 1 January 2018, a single flat tax of 30% is deducted from distributed profit (12.8% as income tax and 17.2% as social security contributions),\n\n\\* individuals in a tax household for which the reference taxable income of the year before last was less than €50,000 (single, divorced or widowed taxpayers) or €75,000 (joint taxpayers) may apply for exemption from payment of 12.8% income tax; shareholders are responsible for making this request for exemption by no later than 30 November of the year preceding payment of the dividend,\n\n\\* the progressive dividend taxation option is still possible and must be stated on the tax return; in this case, the 12.8% flat tax will be deducted from the tax due.

In a world where energy and resources are increasingly scarce and precious, the technologies we retain and develop must demonstrate both their usefulness and their sobriety.\n\nLACROIX is an international technological and industrial group. We want to continue to grow it, but not at any price: we want to design and manufacture electronic equipment and industrial IoT solutions that contribute to the ecological transition.\n\nAnd because words are not enough, we have set ourselves a target with a date and a figure: to reach 80% of impact products in our sales by 2030, compared with 61% in 2022.\n\nThis means foregoing certain markets if they are contrary to our conception of useful technology. But above all it means concentrating our energy and resources on electronic solutions that help build the world of tomorrow: low-carbon mobility, intermodal transport, management of water, heating and electricity networks, technical management of buildings, low-energy and efficient industry, etc.\n\nWe are convinced that these will be the most buoyant markets in the long term... and they already are.\n\n### **2024, here we come!**\n\nIn 2024, we will be stepping up our efforts to meet our 4 commitments: develop our activities that have a positive impact, design eco-efficient solutions, conduct our operations in a sustainable manner and to make a commitment to our teams and our territories:\n\n- Deploying the Impact Score, our impact assessment tool, for each commercial opportunity\n- Constructing the Group's low-carbon trajectory as part of the ACT Step-by-step approach, and setting greenhouse gas emission reduction targets based on the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)\n- Finalising the Ecodesign by LACROIX approach, to ensure that 100% of our new products are eco-designed\n- Deploying a Quality of Life at Work roadmap on each site, in line with the Great Place to Work survey, and roll-out of the Women at Lacroix programme, which aims to improve the representation of women in managerial and expert positions.\n\nThe Executive Committee and I are more determined than ever and convinced that positive impact will generate the most profitable and sustainable growth for LACROIX.\n\n> **Vincent Bedouin**  *Chair*\n\n{43}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **LACROIX values**\n\nBy aligning social and operational rules with these values, LACROIX's teams help to place people at the centre of the organisation. LACROIX managers and their staff thus avail of a reference framework understood by all and invaluable for taking action, coordinating their interactions, and guiding their decision making.\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/3 description: The image shows a line drawing of a rocket ship taking off. Below the rocket ship is a dark blue rectangle with the word \"BOLDNESS\" in white letters.\n\n\"Whether or not you think you can do it, you should always try.\"\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/5 description: The image shows a graphic with two circles, each containing a simple outline of a person. Curved arrows connect the two circles, indicating a cyclical relationship or exchange.

Below the icon is a dark blue rectangle with the word \"RESPECT\" written in white, bold letters.\n\n\"We're a team because we respect each other, trust each other, and care about each other.\"\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/9 description: The image shows a graphic of three people represented by simple line drawings of heads and shoulders. The figures are arranged in a triangular formation, suggesting a group or team. Below the graphic is a dark blue rectangle with the words \"TEAM SPIRIT\" in white, uppercase letters.\n\n**OPEN-MINDEDNESS**\n\n\"If you want to go fast, set off alone. If you want to go far, set off together!\" \"Strength comes from differences, not similarities.\"\n\n## **LACROIX confirms its commitment via external guidelines**\n\nImage /page/43/Picture/14 description: The image shows the logo for Gaia Rating. The logo consists of a circle in blue, with the words \"Gaia\" in blue and \"RATING\" in orange inside the circle.\n\nLACROIX has been preparing for an annual diagnostic and benchmarking exercise since 2018, including the extra-financial procedure conducted by Gaïa Rating. In 2023 (during the 2022 financial year), LACROIX received an ESG score of 63/100 compared to 61/100 in 2022.\n\nImage /page/43/Figure/16 description: The image is a silver Ecovadis Sustainability Rating badge for 2023. The badge is circular with a silver border. The word \"SILVER\" is written in silver on a silver ribbon at the top of the badge. The word \"ecovadis\" is written in green in the center of the badge. Below that, the words \"Sustainability Rating\" are written in black.\n\nIn 2023, LACROIX responded to the Ecovadis assessment questionnaire, which assesses the performance of companies in terms of environment, working conditions, ethics and responsible purchasing. LACROIX obtained a score of 61/100, higher than or equal to 79% of companies rated by Ecovadis and a significant increase compared with 2022 (53/100).\n\nImage /page/43/Figure/18 description: The image is a red square with a white logo and text. The logo is a stylized plus sign with a square in the center, and the text \"CDP\" is to the right of the logo. Below the logo and text is the word \"DISCLOSER\" in a smaller font, and below that is the number \"2023\" in a large font.\n\nIn 2023, for the first time, LACROIX answered the questionnaire of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the international reference body for assessing the climate strategy of organisations. For this first reporting year, we obtained a score of C- Awareness, the average for companies in the electronics sector. We are confident that the actions we are currently putting in place (see section 6.3 on our greenhouse gas emissions) will enable us improve this score in 2024.\n\nFurthermore, LACROIX's strategy and actions are in line with the Sustainable Development Goals, the 10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact and the 8 fundamental conventions of the ILO.\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **Our positive impact strategy**\n\nIn December 2023, LACROIX published its positive impact strategy and 2030 impact objectives.\n\nImage /page/44/Picture/3 description: The image shows four cards with text and images related to sustainability.

The \"R\" in a circle is located at the bottom right corner of the square.\n\nTo understand the expectations of its employees and their relationship with work and the company, and to measure their support for its projects, in 2023 for the first time, LACROIX conducted on all its sites the Great Place to Work satisfaction survey, a global benchmark in this respect. This survey replaces the LACROIX & You internal survey, which was also conducted among all Group employees.\n\nIn 2023, 83% of employees took part in the Great Place to Work survey. The results provide a rich source of information for improvement initiatives.\n\nFollowing this initial survey, 5 LACROIX sites have already been quality-certified as a Great Place to Work in 2023. The next Great Place to Work satisfaction survey will be conducted on all the Group's sites in 2024.\n\n## **1.3 Organisation of corporate dialogue**\n\nLACROIX is committed to establishing high-quality social dialogue with staff representation bodies.\n\nThis dialogue takes the form of work meetings and discussions with staff representation bodies, whose configuration varies according to local legislation. These exchanges are intended to create a responsible and constructive relationship of trust, conducive to business development and employee fulfilment within the Group.\n\nThe Group particularly welcomes the quality of exchanges that took place in relation to the health crisis, which made it possible to introduce measures seeking to protect the health of employees.\n\nWhenever required by law, LACROIX entities have staff representation bodies, which held more than 171 meetings in 2023 across the entire Group (148 in 2022 and 180 in 2021). The Electronics business also holds its European Social and Economic Committee meeting.\n\n## **1.4 Health and safety at work**\n\nLACROIX has a duty and responsibility to protect the health and safety of its employees, and endeavours to assess and improve working conditions and implement accident prevention measures in collaboration with the bodies representing its employees and external stakeholders.\n\n#### **Health, safety, and dedicated training programmes**\n\nAccident prevention and safety are organised through dialogue with various representatives: Social & Economic Committee (CSE), Health & Safety and Working Conditions Committee (CHSCT) or similar organisations on international sites (CCE, etc.). The various health and safety bodies operating within LACROIX cover almost 100% of staff. In a spirit of collaboration and responsibility, those involved ensure LACROIX's compliance with local obligations and regulations and work to roll out training initiatives of a regulatory or preventative nature.\n\n#### **Accidents at work**\n\nThe frequency rate of accidents at work was 6.0 in 2023, compared with 5.6 in 2022 and 6.9 in 2021. The main accidents at work still relate to handling operations. There are regular reminders of safety instructions and good practice in movements and postures.\n\nThe accident severity rate fell by 0.03 points in 2023. The results justify the steps taken to prevent accidents, monitor compliance with security measures, raise awareness around the risks involved in our activities, and ensure that personal protective equipment is worn. These measures are designed for the long term, enabling a steady reduction in the severity rate since 2021, with a drop of 0.08 points between 2021 and 2023.\n\n{53}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### ANNUAL REPORT 2023\n\nOccupational hazard awareness training for new staff in workshops is systematically included as part of their induction process. Regular communication campaigns provide reminders of the guidelines and the importance of this matter, and managers are directly involved in supporting workplace safety approaches.\n\nImage /page/53/Figure/2 description: The image contains a bar chart and a text box. The bar chart shows the frequency rate and severity rate from 2021 to 2023. In 2021, the frequency rate is 6.9 and the severity rate is 0.17. In 2022, the frequency rate is 5.6 and the severity rate is 0.12. In 2023, the frequency rate is 6.0 and the severity rate is 0.09. The text box is titled \"GOOD PRACTICES\" and contains the following text: \"For each accident leading to work stoppage, a diagnostic procedure is implemented with root cause analysis and action plans.\"\n\n(1) Number of workplace accidents with at least 1 day of stoppage \\*1,000,000 / effective work hours. (2) Number of days' stoppage due to workplace accidents \\* 1,000 / effective work hours.\n\nLACROIX makes regular investments intended to improve the working environment of its employees, helping to enhance both safety and comfort.\n\nSome of the most significant examples of this are as follows:\n\n- Acquisition of electric pallet trucks with levellers to avoid handling heavy loads\n- Installation of safety systems for double rack storage at height\n- Installation of smoke extractors at exposed workstations\n- Investments in automatic storage systems to limit handling operations and enhance their safety.\n- Securing circulation areas in workshops\n\n#### **Absenteeism**\n\nAfter two years (2021 and 2022) marked by a high number of absences due to Covid-19, and absenteeism rates of around 8.6%, the absenteeism rate fell sharply to 5.51% in 2023.\n\nShort-term sick leave fell by 1.58%, accounting for most of the absenteeism rate.\n\n|                                          | 2023  | 2022  |\n|------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Short-term illness                       | 3.70% | 5.28% |\n| Occupational illness                     | 0.03% | 0.05% |\n| Workplace and commuting accidents        | 0.04% | 0.10% |\n| Maternity, paternity, and adoption leave | 1.74% | 3.18% |\n| Total absenteeism rate                   | 5.51% | 8.63% |\n\n{54}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Accident prevention and health-related awareness-raising measures**\n\nIn several of the group's entities, prevention measures have been taken to raise awareness among employees of actions that improve their daily work.\n\nLACROIX also provides training courses and exercises required by regulations in all the countries where it operates.\n\nFor instance, its employees are regularly trained or retrained in the use of handling equipment (operator licenses), first-aid (first-responder courses), fire emergencies (front and rear fire-warden training), risks related to the use of hazardous products and chemicals, and the use of high-voltage currents (certification and training).\n\nImage /page/54/Picture/5 description: A person wearing a white lab coat and a virtual reality headset is standing in a room. The person is holding a thin object in their hands and appears to be interacting with the virtual environment. The room has a green wall and a plant in a pot in the background.\n\nA first for the Kwidzyn site in Poland, which in 2023 used an augmented virtual reality device for first-aid training.\n\nThanks to this scheme, 40 employees were given practical first aid and evacuation training.\n\nImage /page/54/Picture/8 description: In a classroom setting, a group of seven individuals, mostly women, are gathered around a black mat on the floor. At the center of the mat is a light brown object, possibly a training dummy or model. Most of the individuals are wearing white lab coats, suggesting a medical or scientific context. One person is wearing a pink shirt. They are all looking down at the object on the mat, possibly observing or participating in a demonstration. The background includes chairs, a table, and a screen with some text or images on it, further indicating an educational or training environment.\n\nFor example, in 2022 the HSE department at the Kwidzyn site in Poland organised a first-aid course. Topics included how to use a defibrillator, how to put an injured person in a lateral position, first aid in case of injury, first aid kit equipment, how to transport injured people using a chair. A total of 130 people were trained.\n\nImage /page/54/Picture/10 description: This image is a promotional poster for mammography screenings. The poster is pink and features the text \"Badania Mammograficzne\" at the top. There are three images of a mobile mammography unit, which is a white van with the letters \"NZF\" on the side. There is also a circular logo with the words \"Support Cancer Awareness\" and a pink ribbon.\n\nIn 2023, the Kwidzyn site in Poland, the Beaupreau site in France and the Zriba site in Tunisia will all be raising awareness of the risk of breast cancer.\n\n{55}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **2. TALENTS AND SKILLS**\n\nIn a rapidly changing technological environment where digital services and data management are ever-more essential, developing skills and retaining talent are key factors for success, identified as major challenges in LACROIX's materiality assessment.\n\n## **2.1 Gender equality**\n\nImage /page/55/Picture/4 description: The image shows the number of women and men. The number of women is 2,702 and the number of men is 2,396. The symbol for women is on the left and the symbol for men is on the right.\n\n**Women account for 53% of the group's workforce in 2023** (an increase of one point compared to 2022 when women made up 55% of the workforce).\n\nThey account for **58% of the Electronics Activity's staff**, which employs a predominantly female workforce in its workshops.\n\nLACROIX closely monitors the equal treatment of men and women in the workplace. Each activity takes account of wage gaps that may exist between men and women, seeking to reduce any such gaps.\n\nIn addition to Company-level agreements and mandatory action plans, specific measures are in place to make it easier for women to carry out a professional activity.\n\nIn 2023, the gender equality index will be above 75 points for most of the Group's companies based in France, for which this indicator must be calculated (companies with more than 50 employees). Companies with an index below 75 points have drawn up an action plan to improve the index through targeted measures.\n\nImage /page/55/Picture/10 description: The image is a circular logo for \"Women at Lacroix\". The logo consists of a large, stylized letter \"W\" in a dark blue color, centered within a circle. The words \"WOMEN AT LACROIX\" are arranged around the circumference of the circle, also in dark blue. The text is evenly spaced and follows the curve of the circle, creating a border around the central \"W\".\n\nIn 2023, LACROIX committed to improving the representation of women in technical professions, particularly in management and expertise, through an internal \"Women at LACROIX\" programme. The initiative proposes various actions to be implemented to promote our professions to schoolchildren and offer training, such as the fight against everyday sexism and unconscious bias. It also involves participating in a number of targeted partnerships: Elles Bougent, StOpE, IndustriElles.\n\nImage /page/55/Picture/12 description: The image shows the logo for \"Industrielles\". The word \"Industrielles\" is written in blue, with the \"E\" in \"Industrielles\" stylized with three horizontal lines. To the right of the word is a blue circle with two vertical white lines inside.\n\n*IndustriElles* is a programme run by the Ministry of Industry to mobilise men and women in industry to actively promote gender diversity in the industrial sector. In 2023, we signed our commitment to contribute to the initiative by implementing the various recommendations proposed.\n\nElles bougent\n\n*Elles bougent* is a widely-recognised association whose aim is to increase gender diversity in companies in the industrial and technological sectors. The association's activities help raise awareness of the industrial and technical professions among schoolchildren and young female students. It is also a programme of mentors who help young people choose and follow our career paths. LACOIX has been a member of the association since 2023.\n\nImage /page/55/Picture/16 description: The image shows the logo for Technovation Girls France. The word \"TECHNOVATION\" is in blue, with a green leaf-like design to the left. Below that, \"Girls France\" is written in green and blue.\n\nIn 2023, we informed our employees of the option of registering their daughters aged between 13 and 17 to take part in the Technovation Girls France association, which supports young girls with mentoring and sessions to help them build an entrepreneurial project around technology.\n\n{56}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **2.2 Training**\n\nStaff training is a key priority, contributing to employee upskilling and individual fulfilment of potential. It is important for the effective involvement of everyone within the Group, and drives collective success.\n\nEach LACROIX activity defines its annual training plan, taking into account the development areas The group's strategies, the needs expressed by managers and the wishes expressed by employees.\n\nThe Group set aside 74,591 hours of training for its teams in 2023, compared with 50,385 hours in 2022. Sustained training efforts. The educational budget allocated to training was stable in 2023 at €734K, compared with €732K in 2022. Figures from the Juarez site in Mexico are consolidated in the reported figures, which was not the case in 2022.\n\nThis training covers support for developing new business-specific expertise and processes, introducing new business tools and software, further digitalisation of tools, and taking on new responsibilities.\n\nAcross LACROIX activities, training initiatives break down as follows:\n\n|                   | ELECTRONICS        |                | CITY               |                | ENVIRONMENT        |                |\n|-------------------|--------------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------|\n|                   | Number of<br>hours | Budget<br>(€K) | Number of<br>hours | Budget<br>(€K) | Number of<br>hours | Budget<br>(€K) |\n| Training provided | 65,907             | 397            | 5,480              | 218            | 2,984              | 106            |\n\n220 hours of training were also provided in relation to LACROIX Corp. activities, for a budget of €13K.\n\n#### **GOOD PRACTICES**\n\nLACROIX has introduce a training course leading to a diploma, aimed at developing a managerial, environmental and leadership culture.\n\n**LACROIX Corporate Executive Program for senior executives**\n\nThe classes include trainees with international profiles and trainees from business lines representative of the Group.\n\nAll share a common foundation built on the Group's vision, values, and management principles.\n\n13 managers graduated on the 2022-2023 LACROIX Corporate Executive programme, successfully completing the programme launched in October 2023.\n\nImage /page/56/Picture/15 description: The image shows a presentation in front of an audience.

The total number of women is 2702, and the total number of men is 2396.\n\n### **Workforce breakdown by age bracket**\n\nThe workforce is characterised by young and predominantly female staff.\n\nIn 2022, 53% of the LACROIX workforce were under 40 (56% in 2022), and 8% over 55 (7% in 2022).\n\n#### **Geographical breakdown**\n\nThe story of LACROIX began in France. The development of the Group's activities over recent years has seen it support customers and conquer new markets internationally.\n\nThis international development has naturally been accompanied by changes in the geographical distribution of its workforce. As a result of the acquisition of Firstronics in North America 75% of the workforce is located outside France in 2023, compared with 77% in 2022.\n\n| LACROIX has bases more particularly in: |                 |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| United States                           | 181 employees   |\n| Mexico                                  | 1,159 employees |\n| Poland                                  | 1,383 employees |\n| France                                  | 1,296 employees |\n| Tunisia                                 | 732 employees   |\n| Germany                                 | 240 employees   |\n| Spain                                   | 82 employees    |\n| Belgium                                 | 13 employees    |\n| Italy                                   | 10 employees    |\n\nImage /page/61/Figure/9 description: The image shows the text '2 employees are based in Singapore, and Morocco.'\n\nImage /page/61/Figure/10 description: The image is a stacked bar chart comparing data from 2022 and 2023. The y-axis ranges from 500 to 6,000. For 2022, the stacked bars represent different categories: France and Growth Overseas (1,208), Europe-Americas (2,115), North Africa (696), North America (1,296), and Others. For 2023, the corresponding values are: France and Growth Overseas (1,296), Europe-Americas (1,728), North Africa (732), North America (1,340), and Others. The chart also indicates percentage changes between the two years for each category: +7%, -18%, +5%, and +3%.\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **3. SHARING AND ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH ETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES AND CONDUCT**\n\nLACROIX is committed to conducting its activities according to operational principles and conduct founded on respect and integrity. Its requirements in terms of transparency and combating corruption have been strengthened by the obligations introduced under the \"Sapin II\" Law.\n\nThe Group's strategic development plan, particularly in terms of business development and international growth, further underlines its requirements with regard to business ethics and behaviours, combating corruption, and compliance.\n\nLACROIX has strengthened its governance and anti-corruption mechanisms and pursues a policy of zero tolerance towards corruption in all its activities and across all territories where it operates. These actions are undertaken at the very highest level of the Company's Management.\n\n## **3.1 Combating corruption**\n\nLACROIX conducts an ongoing process of identifying and assessing its main risks, leading to the reinforcement of its internal rules within the framework of its codes of conduct, which cover in particular the fight against corruption and the rules to observe in competition matters. It has also drawn up practical guides to help manage risks on a day-to-day basis, including a policy on gifts and entertainment. These documents are given to new employees and can be accessed by anyone at any time on the Group's legal intranet.\n\nThe teams most exposed to corruption-related requests (sales, purchases, etc.) are trained in the applicable anticorruption procedure. By the end of 2023, more than 670 employees had received training in anti-corruption rules.\n\n## **3.2 Whistleblowing system**\n\nLACROIX has a centralised whistleblowing system for collecting and processing reports of any actual or potential breaches of the law, regulations, and LACROIX's principles, guidelines and internal policies, including the applicable \"anti-corruption\" and \"competition\" Codes of Conduct.\n\nProcessing a whistleblower's report improves risk identification and prevention processes, from a perspective of continuous improvement and risk management.\n\n## **3.3 Selecting suppliers**\n\nIn 2023, LACROIX defined its Responsible Purchasing policy and set up 8 working groups aimed in particular at improving the CSR practices of its partners, identifying eco-designed solutions, reducing its packaging consumption and optimising its logistics flows.\n\nTo take better account of the CSR performance of our partners, in addition to their economic, logistics and quality performance, we have introduced an annual assessment of our strategic suppliers, which takes into account their ethical, social and environmental practices.\n\nWe aim to have 75% of our purchasing volume covered by this CSR assessment by 2025.\n\nLACROIX's Responsible Purchasing policy is also reflected in a code of good conduct addressed to all suppliers, who must undertake to comply with it.\n\nOur Purchasing Department, in partnership with our Quality Department, conducts audits of our suppliers in order to ensure that our requirements are duly met.\n\nThese audits may concern several aspects at once, such as the ability of the supplier to meet our needs, their technical capabilities, their quality system management, their adherence to environmental regulations, and their compliance with labour legislation.\n\nEach year, LACROIX also updates a risk map of its supply chain, taking into account country risk, financial risk and potential monopoly situations in order to better assess risks and prioritise security measures accordingly.\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **3.4 Equal treatment and non-discrimination**\n\nIn all the countries in which it operates, LACROIX observes the principles set out in the ILO Conventions, in particular the \"Fundamental Conventions\" concerning fundamental rights at work: freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour, the effective abolition of child labour, and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.\n\nLACROIX employs staff with diverse profiles from quite a broad range of geographical origins. LACROIX regards diversity, inclusion, and multiculturalism as vital factors for complementarity and enrichment. LACROIX asserts its commitment to work towards equal employment and against discrimination, and reaffirms its commitment to eliminate any form of discrimination with respect to employment and to the promotion of diversity.\n\nWithin the framework of company-level agreements and targeted actions, LACROIX encourages diversity within its teams, defines objectives and measures in favour of gender equality in the workplace and promotes the employment of people with disabilities through part-payment of apprenticeship taxes to the GIRPEH (disabled employment association), and more generally seeks to combat workplace discrimination, particularly through the implementation of its key processes such as recruitment, individual assessments, wage increase policies, etc. In 2023, no cases of discrimination were reported.\n\n## **3.5 Geopolitical risks – Service continuity**\n\nThe LACROIX Group has identified the areas in which it has significant manufacturing activity and which are particularly exposed to geopolitical risks. It is the group's Electronics business that is mainly affected, with delivery issues for its customers that can be significant. Accordingly, business continuity plans (BCPs) are drawn up in order to be in a position to best meet commitments made, even in a crisis. Zriba's BCP proved its robustness during the fire that affected the site in 2019.\n\nPreventive and corrective measures are taken. From a preventive point of view, there is a system for identifying risks as early as possible (weak signals, global assessments, information on the sector, etc.). As far as corrective measures are concerned, measures are taken at operational level (organisation of production, reallocation of production between sites, building up safety stocks), at the logistics level (storage locations, transport flows, supplier relations), and also at product design level, in order to ensure great reactivity in the event of a crisis.\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **4.

activity.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **5. CONTRIBUTING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE REGIONAL SOCIO-ECONOMIC FABRIC**\n\nLACROIX plays a significant role in terms of local employment (direct and indirect) and regional development.\n\nThe ELECTRONICS business is a major economic player in its areas of activity in France (more than 450 jobs in the Communauté des Mauges, more than 350 jobs also in the Nantes basin and more than 250 jobs in the Rennes basin), in Tunisia (second largest employer in the Zriba enterprise zone with nearly 700 direct jobs) and in Poland (third largest employer in the Kwidzyn region with approximately 1,800 direct jobs). It plays a key role in regional balance within the rural areas in which it is based on each of these sites.\n\nAcross all the areas of activity in which it operates, LACROIX seeks to contribute to economic, social, and regional development through direct initiatives or support for local initiatives.\n\n### **5.1 Economic development**\n\nImage /page/65/Picture/6 description: The image shows the logo for INNOVATION LAB BY LACROIX. The words \"INNOVATION LAB\" are in large, bold, dark blue letters. Below that, the words \"BY LACROIX\" are in smaller, dark blue letters. To the right of \"BY LACROIX\" are three red bars that are slanted to the right. The bars are on top of a red rectangle.\n\nLocated near Rennes, **Innovation Lab by LACROIX** is developing a network of partners and working to discover new uses and develop new technologies.\n\nThe Lab interacts with many local stakeholders to develop ideas and promote innovative, concrete and deployable solutions to today's and tomorrow's societal challenges and problems: schools, research laboratories, start-ups, local authorities, companies.\n\nThe team's actions with local and business ecosystems are key: to quickly identify companies that can help us meet today's challenges and jointly develop tomorrow's solutions with them, to share best practices within our ecosystem in order to challenge our current processes and to inspire each other in order to generate innovative projects hand in hand.\n\nImage /page/65/Picture/10 description: The image shows a logo with a stylized fox on the left and the text \"#ANGERS FRENCHTECH\" on the right. The fox is depicted in a geometric, low-poly style, with shades of red and pink. The text is in a sans-serif font and is colored gray. The hashtag symbol is placed before \"ANGERS\", and \"FRENCHTECH\" is positioned below \"#ANGERS\".\n\n#### **Commitment to intelligent territories**\n\nBeyond his missions within LACROIX, Stéphane Gervais, EVP Strategic Innovation of the LACROIX group, is closely involved in the territories and particularly in the **French Tech in Angers,** where he devotes his time and skills to the community on the Smart City theme, as well as in Nantes, where he is a member of the assessment committee of the **Nantes City Lab.**\n\nHe is also involved in the development of international mid-sized cities within the framework of **SIIVIM** and is a member of the OECD's **\"Smart Cities and Inclusive Growth\"** group.\n\nImage /page/65/Picture/14 description: The image is a circular logo or emblem with a blurred background of what appears to be a modern transportation hub, possibly a train station or airport. The central text is in French, with the word \"CHAIRE\" in a smaller, lighter font above the phrase \"MOBILITÉ DANS UNE VILLE DURABLE\" which translates to \"Mobility in a Sustainable City.\" The text is sandwiched between two thin, horizontal red lines. The overall design is clean and suggests a focus on sustainable urban mobility.\n\nLACROIX is a partner of the **\"Mobility in a sustainable city\" Research Chair** of the **Rennes 1 Foundation** with Rennes Métropole, the Legendre group, Keolis Rennes and the SNCF. The chair is held by Laurent Denant-Boëmont and François Bodin, research professors respectively at the *Centre de Recherche en Economie et Management* and the *Institut de Recherche en Informatique et Systèmes Aléatoires*: It works on issues at metropolitan level, both in terms of socio-economic studies (behavioural studies and public policy evaluation) and experimentation of innovative technological solutions, and also considers cybersecurity issues for smart-cities. In these fields of expertise, the Chair is involved in the creation of innovative companies and services, and participates in collaborative research projects\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\nANNUAL REPORT 2023\n\nImage /page/66/Picture/1 description: The image contains the logo for \"we network ACCÉLÉRATEUR D'INDUSTRIE\". The logo features a stylized letter \"N\" in teal, with a rounded shape and a small teal dot above it. Below the symbol, the words \"we network\" are written in a bold, dark blue font. Underneath \"we network\", the phrase \"ACCÉLÉRATEUR D'INDUSTRIE\" is written in a smaller, lighter blue font.\n\nThe **We Network** cluster is a resource centre for smart systems (continuous improvement, AIV, cobots, IT, system integration, additive manufacturing, and IoT) of which **Vincent Bedouin** has been President since its creation. This cluster is based in Angers, an area with an industrial tradition and that is home to the **greatest density of electronic production sites** in France (25% of all employment in the French electronics industry, or 50,000 jobs). The key roles of We Network are:\n\n- **• To promote** the potential of the French professional electronics sector (laboratories, design offices, industrial manufacturers, educational institutes),\n- **• To support electronics stakeholders** and users (all fields, all locations) with innovative projects,\n- **• To oversee the WISE programme,** offering advice and expertise at European level to stakeholders in electronic design and production in western France (Brittany, Centre, and Loire).\n\n## **5.2 Promotion of industry professions**\n\nMinistère\nde l'Économie\net des Finances\n\nImage /page/66/Picture/8 description: The image is a poster for \"La Semaine de l'Industrie\" (Industry Week), which takes place from November 27th to December 1st, 2023. The poster features a stylized illustration of three people working in an industrial setting. One person is wearing a white hard hat and holding a tablet, another is wearing a white hard hat and adjusting a valve on a pink pipe, and the third is sitting in front of a laptop. The text \"AVEC L'INDUSTRIE, FABRIQUE TON AVENIR\" (With Industry, Build Your Future) is prominently displayed on the poster.\n\nLACROIX regularly takes part in events intended to raise awareness of the industry's professions and to strengthen the link between the Company and its stakeholders, in universities above all.\n\nIn Poland, the Electronics Activity is pursuing its cooperation with 2 local universities to promote professions within the electronics industry. As such, as part of its \"School close to work\" programme. The various sites regularly welcome visits from young students to raise their awareness of industrial jobs.\n\nThe Electronics Activity also contributes to the content of technical programmes in order to provide the best employment opportunities for young students.\n\nLACROIX also regularly participates in professional forums that take place near the Group's various sites.\n\nLACROIX remains faithful to the \"Industry Week\" organised by the French Metal Industry and Trade Union. As part of the 2023 event, LACROIX employees spoke with teachers and students in discussion workshops organised by schools, local employment initiatives, and colleges.\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **6. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT**\n\nLACROIX's role as a technology partner in the fields of Smart City, Smart Environment, and Smart Industry puts it at the heart of environmental preservation challenges. The Group's teams design increasingly smart products and solutions to reduce urban light pollution and traffic in cities, optimise water resource management, consume less energy, etc.\n\nIn its operations and development, LACROIX strives to reduce its environmental footprint and encourages its stakeholders to do likewise.\n\nTo that end, the Group is pursuing a proactive policy aimed at achieving **ISO 14001** certification for all its main industrial sites.\n\nAll these sites have an organisation and management systems that enable them to monitor and reduce the environmental impact of their activities. The indicators monitored ensure the effectiveness of corrective measures and continuous improvements made.\n\nIn addition, all the Group's sites make sure to:\n\n- Use environmentally friendly processes\n- Work to reduce and recover waste\n- Manage energy and water consumption\n- Reduce their carbon footprint\n\nIn 2023, to further improve our practices, we launched \"Eco-flux\" diagnostics, a scheme set up by ADEME and Bpifrance to optimise energy, materials, waste and water flows. We have started with our main French sites and will be extending the scheme internationally in 2024.\n\nFinally, we have launched the *Committed Site* initiative, which aims to make the Group's positive impact strategy a reality on our sites. Each site has set up a working group, which makes proposals and takes actions in a number of areas (energy, waste, food, mobility, biodiversity, etc.).\n\n### **6.1 Waste reduction and recovery**\n\nLACROIX's activities generate various types of waste: WEEE, plastics, metals, cardboard, mixed waste, hazardous waste...\n\n2,161 tonnes of common industrial waste was generated in 2023, up from 1,681 tonnes in 2022. This difference is mainly due to a reporting error in 2022 at our Mexican site.\n\nThe quantity of hazardous industrial waste produced remains limited and under control at 173 tonnes, down from 217 tonnes in 2022.\n\nLACROIX's sites work to reduce the amount of waste they generate and entrust their waste to approved waste collection and recovery service providers.\n\nIn 2023, 75% of the common industrial waste generated was recycled, compared with 93% in 2022. This sharp fall is explained by a more accurate categorisation of waste categories and end-of-life scenarios in 2023.\n\nOn all its production sites, the LACROIX Group has set up systematic sorting of hazardous waste, which is also entrusted to approved service providers.\n\nFinally, the Group is also working with its suppliers and customers to reduce packaging waste by introducing reusable or recyclable packaging, such as shuttle crates.\n\nImage /page/67/Figure/21 description: The image shows a bar graph comparing the amount of ordinary industrial waste (OIW) and hazardous industrial waste (HIW) in tonnes for the years 2022 and 2023. In 2022, the OIW was 1,681 tonnes and the HIW was 277 tonnes. In 2023, the OIW was 2,161 tonnes and the HIW was 173 tonnes. Additionally, the image states that 75% of OIW is recycled.\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **6.2 Energy consumption management**\n\nIn 2023, the overall energy consumption of the Group's sites remained stable.\n\nTo reduce energy consumption and improve the energy performance of its sites, LACROIX regularly invests in heating systems and building management systems (which intelligently control and regulate boilers, air heaters and other pieces of equipment).\n\n| Consumption<br>levels | 2023 | 2022 |\n|-----------------------|------|------|\n| Electricity           | 28.1 | 24   |\n| Gas                   | 3.8  | 7.5  |\n| Heating systems       | 1.8  | 1.8  |\n| Fuel oil              | 0.1  | 0    |\n| TOTAL (GWh)           | 33.8 | 33.3 |\n\nLACROIX also continues to invest in more energyefficient LED lighting systems on most of its sites.\n\nIn 2023, the Group joined the Estuaire Energie cooperative, with a view to supplying its French sites over the coming years through renewable power purchase agreements (PPAs). Investigations are also underway at the Group's largest sites abroad, in Poland, Tunisia and Mexico.\n\n## **6.3 Greenhouse gas emissions**\n\n#### **The LACROIX Group's carbon footprint**\n\nAs an international industrial company, LACROIX has a responsibility to act to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\n\nIn 2022, with the support of an external consultancy, LACROIX carried out a complete carbon assessment (scopes 1, 2 and 3) of all its activities in 2021, supplemented in 2023 by the carbon assessment of the American subsidiary of its Electronics business, acquired in the final days of 2021.\n\nThe LACROIX Group's total carbon footprint in 2021, including its American subsidiary, was 3.571 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2e):\n\n- Scope 1 = 2.8 Kt CO2e\n- Scope 2 = 12.1 Kt CO2e\n- Scope 3 upstream = 588 Kt CO2e\n- Scope 3 downstream = 2,968 Kt CO2e.\n\nThe main types of emission making up this footprint are as follows:\n\n- Use of the products sold: 2,931 KtCO2e, or 82% of the Group's footprint\n- Purchases (production and non-production): 569 KtCO2e, or 16% of the Group's footprint\n- Freight: 23 KtCO2e, 74% from upstream freight and 26% from downstream freight\n- End of life of sold products: 20 KtCO2e, including the collection, sorting and recovery of WEEE, plastic, metal and cardboard that make up our products and their packaging\n- Energy: 14 KtCO2e, from our consumption of electricity (87%), natural gas (10%) and district heating (3%).\n- Travel: 8 KtCO2e, from commuting (85%) and business trips (15%)\n\nIt should be noted that from 2024 (for financial year 2023), LACROIX will conduct an annual carbon audit of all its activities, in order to report on the achievement of its GHG emission reduction targets (see below).\n\n{69}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **LACROIX climate strategy**\n\nIn March 2023, LACROIX made a commitment to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to publicly announce GHG emission reduction targets aligned with the Paris Agreements within no more than two years.\n\nIn order to set these targets and build a climate trajectory and an operational, budgeted roadmap, in November 2023 we launched an *ACT Step by step* project, a scheme created and subsidised by ADEME.\n\nThroughout 2024, we will be holding workshops with representatives of the various business lines (finance, R&D, purchasing, production, marketing, etc.) from our 3 main activities (Electronics, City and Environment), in order to build the Group's climate trajectory and set GHG emission reduction targets that will be submitted to SBTi.\n\n## **6.4 Sustainable mobility**\n\nIn 2023 we launched a Sustainable Mobility Plan to promote low-carbon modes of transport for commuter journeys, which account for 85% of travel-related emissions within the Group. The plan, which has been rolled out at all Group sites with the exception of two sites at our US subsidiary, promotes carpooling, public transport and cycling.\n\nIn France, this means:\n\n- Carpooling: in early 2023, we signed a partnership agreement with BlaBlaCar Daily to encourage carpooling (welcome bonus, partial subsidy of journeys, communication campaigns, etc.)\n- Public transport: where possible, we set up partnerships with the local authorities where our sites are located so that our employees can benefit from reduced season ticket prices. This is particularly true of our sites in the Nantes and Rennes conurbations.\n- Cycling: in 2023 we introduced the Sustainable Mobility Package, which partly subsidises journeys made by our employees who come by bike or scooter.\n\nInternational initiatives depend on the local context and regulations. For example, our Kwidzyn site in Poland has developed a carpooling scheme for the site's employees, and our Zriba site in Tunisia has set up special bus services reserved for LACROIX employees.\n\nImage /page/69/Picture/12 description: A person is riding a white bicycle on a paved road.

Below the circle and text is the text \"DRIVING AMBITIOUS CORPORATE CLIMATE ACTION\" in a smaller sans-serif font.\n\nImage /page/69/Picture/14 description: The image shows the logo for ACT, which stands for Assessing Low Carbon Transition. The letters ACT are in red, and the words \"ASSESSING LOW CARBON TRANSITION\" are in gray. A registered trademark symbol is to the right of the word \"TRANSITION\".\n\n{70}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/70/Picture/1 description: A man in a blue suit is standing in front of a complex system of pipes and valves, holding a laptop and a blue hard hat. He is looking at the laptop screen and typing on the keyboard. The pipes and valves are various shades of blue and gray, and they are connected to a large blue tank in the background. The man has a beard and short dark hair. He is wearing a white shirt under his suit jacket.\n\n## **6.5 Recognition of our impact solutions**\n\nWe take action every day to limit our impact, but we also offer our customers solutions to help them reduce their ecological footprint. These solutions have been praised by experts for their effectiveness and added value for customers.\n\nThree LACROIX solutions stood out in this respect in 2023:\n\n- Prio V2X, a solution designed to ease the flow of public transport traffic and contribute to the decarbonisation of cities through implementation of an ecosystem geared to smart vehicles, was chosen from a selection of 100 solutions to accelerate the ecological transition presented to the European Commission in June.\n- AIRoads, a project conducted in collaboration with start-up WaltR, which aims to reconcile mobility and air quality, was also selected from this selection of 100 solutions and was awarded the prize for Sustainable Artificial Intelligence at the WAICF 2023 (World AI Cannes Forum)\n- Finally, Aquawize, our AI-based software solution, is a decision-making tool that automatically analyses and detects problems in water supply networks at an early stage. It was also selected as one of the 100 solutions for accelerating the ecological transition.\n\n#### In addition, Aquawize\n\n• won the Innovative Solution Award, a prestigious prize for the most innovative and sustainable solutions in the water sector by Water Europe (an initiative launched by the European Commission to improve coordination and collaboration in the water sector and contribute to solving global challenges through research and innovation).\n\n- won the Alliancy trophy for meaningful digital technology in the Environmental Impact category.\n- won the Tech4Green Award in the French-speaking Village at CES Las Vegas 2023\n\n• won the Planinium Future Digital Awards for Smart Cities & IoT Innovation 2023 from Juniper Research (a consultancy specialising in long-term forecasting and digital technology markets) in the Most Innovative Urban Sustainability Project category.\n\n{71}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **ELIGIBILITY AND ALIGNMENT WITH THE EUROPEAN TAXONOMY**\n\nThe EU Green Taxonomy is a system for classifying economic activities to identify those that are environmentally sustainable.\n\nIn accordance with Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of June 2020, supplemented by Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 of June 2021 and Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486 of June 2023 of the European Commission, LACROIX has analysed the eligibility and alignment of its activities in financial year 2023 with the **European Taxonomy**.\n\nGiven the complexity of our supply chain, with tens of thousands of electronic component references, it is currently very difficult for LACROIX to guarantee its compliance with the **Do No Significant Harm (DNSH)** principle (according to which, in order to be considered aligned, economic activities must not cause significant harm to other environmental objectives defined by the European Taxonomy), as well as with **minimum social guarantees (Minimum Social Safeguards).**\n\nWe could have considered that compliance with the regulations in the countries where we operate, as well as the contractual obligation of our suppliers to do likewise, were sufficient to ensure that our activities meet these two sustainability criteria (DNSH and MSS), but on the advice of an external consultancy, we preferred to adopt a **conservative approach**. Accordingly, although the majority of LACROIX's eligible activities meet the technical criteria of the European Taxonomy, we now consider that LACROIX's activities are not aligned with the sustainability criteria of the European Taxonomy. We reserve the right to change our position in the coming years, depending on further due diligence done in the future.\n\n#### **REVENUE IN 2023 ELIGIBILITY AND ALIGNMENT OF LACROIX ACTIVITIES WITH THE EUROPEAN TAXONOMY**\n\n| Sales as a proportion of total revenue |                                    |     |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----|\n| Aligned with the taxonomy by objective | Eligible for taxonomy by objective |     |\n| Climate Change Mitigation (CCM)        | 0%                                 | 31% |\n| Climate Change Adaptation (CCA)        | 0%                                 | 26% |\n| Water and Marine Resources (WTR)       | Not required                       | 7%  |\n| Circular Economy (CE)                  | Not required                       | 91% |\n| Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) | Not required                       | 0%  |\n| Biodiversity and ecosystems (BIO)      | Not required                       | 0%  |\n\nThe new regulatory tables required by the taxonomy (see below) offer greater granularity and transparency. They allow us to specify which category of each of the six environmental objectives (see \"Code\" column) our different products are eligible for (see Economic activities column) and to indicate which environmental objective they contribute most to (category in bold in the Code column).\n\n{72}------------------------------------------------\n\n|                                                                                                                              |                              |               | Substantial contribution criteria       |                                   |                                   |           |               |                         |                   |  |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------|---------------|-------------------------|-------------------|--|\n| Economic activities (1)                                                                                                      | Code (a) (2)                 | Revenue (3)   | Proportion<br>of revenue,<br>year N (4) | Climate change<br>mitigation (5)  | Adapting to climate<br>change (6) | Water (7) | Pollution (8) | Circular<br>economy (9) | Biodiversity (10) |  |\n| A.2 Activities eligible under the taxonomy but not environmentally sustainable<br>(not aligned with the taxonomy) (g)        |                              |               |                                         |                                   |                                   |           |               |                         |                   |  |\n| Environment Activity                                                                                                         |                              |               |                                         |                                   |                                   |           |               |                         |                   |  |\n| SOFREL                                                                                                                       |                              |               |                                         |                                   |                                   |           |               |                         |                   |  |\n| HVAC : remote management<br>of facilities                                                                                    | CCM 3.5 -

This methodological guide for internal Group use sets out the definitions and methodologies to be applied in order to ensure the consistency of consolidated information.\n\nThis CSR report has been reviewed by the independent third-party body EY.\n\nWith regard to the scope covered:\n\n- The workforce indicators cover 100% of the scope. The social and societal indicators do not include companies with fewer than 20 employees, and some do not include our workforce in Mexico (in which case this is specified in the text).\n- The environmental indicators cover industrial and semi-industrial sites with more than 50 employees, representing 95% of the group's consolidated turnover and 95% of the workforce. Industrial and semiindustrial sites with fewer than 50 employees, as well as office sites, are excluded from the reporting scope because their environmental impacts are negligible compared to the Group's industrial sites, and because several data sets are not available for these sites (in particular waste monitoring data).\n\nGiven the nature of our activities, we consider that the following themes: actions to promote the link between the Nation and the Army and to support commitment to the reserves, the fight against food waste, the fight against food insecurity, respect for animal welfare and responsible, fair and sustainable food do not constitute the main CSR risks and do not warrant a development in this report. As far as physical and sports activities are concerned, their promotion is left to the discretion of each site.\n\nThe Group has not implemented any practices aimed at artificially reducing its corporation tax or moving its taxable income to tax havens.\n\nLACROIX monitors tax contributions made by organisations by country of location.\n\nTransfer pricing documentation is monitored and updated on a regular basis and is subject to audits and inspections.\n\nIn this respect, LACROIX is not at risk of attempting tax evasion.\n\nThe reporting period corresponds to the fiscal year, i.e. from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023. The stated comparative basis therefore refers to the period running from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022, i.e. the equivalent period for the previous fiscal year.\n\nAfter you have read the reports submitted by your Statutory Auditors, the Board asks you to adopt the resolutions on which you are required to vote.\n\n> Drawn up in Saint-Herblain, on 26 March 2023 The Board of Directors\n\n{77}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **FIVE-YEAR FINANCIAL SUMMARY AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT AREAS**\n\n| Nature of items                                                                                           | 2017/2018  | 2018 / 2019 | 2019 / 2020 | 2021       | 2022       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|------------|\n| CAPITAL AT YEAR END                                                                                       |            |             |             |            |            |\n| - Share capital                                                                                           | 25 000 000 | 25 000 000  | 25 000 000  | 32 055 239 | 32 055 239 |\n| - Number of existing ordinary shares                                                                      | 3 766 560  | 3 766 560   | 3 766 560   | 4 829 096  | 4 829 096  |\n| - Number of preference shares (non-voting)                                                                |            |             |             |            |            |\n| - Maximum number of future shares to be created                                                           |            |             |             |            |            |\n| TRANSACTIONS AND REVENUE FROM THE FINANCIAL YEAR                                                          |            |             |             |            |            |\n| - Revenue net of taxes                                                                                    | 4 155 210  | 6 098 794   | 9 944 480   | 10 274 844 | 13 172 772 |\n| - Pre-tax profit, employee profit-sharing, depreciation,<br>allowances and provisions                     | 4 040 601  | 3 652 372   | 173 477     | 4 679 451  | 11 396 919 |\n| - Income taxes                                                                                            | -3 575 140 | -4 619 761  | - 5 919 185 | -3 969 767 | 3 598 451  |\n| - Employee profit-sharing payable for the year                                                            | 0          | 0           | 0           | 0          | 0          |\n| - Profit after tax, employee profit-sharing, depreciation,<br>allowances and provisions                   | 7 193 223  | 8 578 017   | 6 091 533   | 8 640 922  | 14 518 488 |\n| - Distributed profit                                                                                      | 2 711 923  | 3 389 904   | 2 561 261   | 4 104 732  | 3 863 277  |\n| EARNINGS PER SHARE                                                                                        |            |             |             |            |            |\n| - Profit after tax, employee profit-sharing, before<br>depreciation, allowances and provisions            | 2,02       | 2,20        | 1,62        | 1,79       | 1,61       |\n| - Profit after tax, employee profit-sharing, depreciation,<br>allowances and provisions                   | 1,91       | 2,28        | 1,62        | 1,79       | 3,01       |\n| - Dividend per share                                                                                      | 0,72       | 0,90        | 0,68        | 0,85       | 0,80       |\n| PERSONNEL                                                                                                 |            |             |             |            |            |\n| - Average number of employees during the year                                                             | 12         | 27          | 27          | 27         | 64         |\n| - Total payroll for the year                                                                              | 1 633 085  | 2 592 440   | 4 588 082   | 4 889 575  | 4 850 541  |\n| - Total amount paid for employee benefits in the year<br>(social security, company welfare schemes, etc.) | 784 637    | 1 411 738   | 2 407 622   | 2 272 238  | 2 172 581  |\n\nDrawn up in Saint-Herblain,\n\non 26 March 2022\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY'S REPORT ON CONSOLIDATED NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENT**\n\n#### **LACROIX Group**\n\nYear ended the 12 31, 2023\n\n*This is a free translation into English of the original report issued in the French language and it is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking users. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France.*\n\nTo the General Assembly,\n\nIn our quality as an independent third party, accredited by the COFRAC (Accreditation COFRAC Inspection, n° 3-1681, scope of accreditation available on the website www.cofrac.fr), and as a member of the network of one of the statutory auditors of your Lacroix Group (hereinafter \"Lacroix Group\"), we conducted our work in order to provide a conclusion expressing a limited assurance on the compliance of the consolidated non-financial statement for the year ended 12 31, 2023 (hereinafter the «Statement») with the provisions of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and on the fairness of the historical information (whether observed or extrapolated) provided pursuant to 3° of I and II of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code (hereinafter the «Information») prepared in accordance with the Lacroix Group's procedures (hereinafter the «Guidelines»), included in the management report pursuant to the requirements of articles L. 225 102-1, R. 225-105 and R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).\n\n#### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed as described under the \"Nature and scope of procedures\" and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that cause us to believe that the consolidated non-financial statement is not prepared in accordance with the applicable regulatory provisions and that the Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines, in all material respects.\n\n#### **Preparation of the non-financial performance statement**\n\nThe absence of a commonly used generally accepted reporting framework or a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure the Information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques that can affect comparability between entities and over time.\n\nConsequently, the Information needs to be read and understood together with the Guidelines, summarised in the Statement or, on request from the LACROIX Group's management\n\n#### **Limitations inherent in the preparation of the Information**\n\nThe information may be subject to uncertainty inherent in the state of scientific or economic knowledge and the quality of external data used. Some information is sensitive to the choice of methodology and the assumptions or estimates used for its preparation and presented in the Statement.\n\n#### **Responsibility of the LACROIX Group**\n\nIt is the responsibility of the Management to:\n\n- select or establish appropriate criteria for the preparation of the Information;\n- prepare a Statement pursuant to legal and regulatory provisions, including a presentation of the business model, a description of the main non-financial risks, a presentation of the policies implemented considering those risks as well as the outcomes of said policies, including key performance indicators and, the information set-out in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (green taxonomy);\n- prepare the Statement by applying the LACROIX Group's \"Guidelines\" as referred above; and to\n- implement the internal control procedures it deems necessary to ensure that the Information is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe Statement has been endorsed by the Board of Directors.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Responsibility of the independent third party**\n\nBased on our work, our responsibility is to provide a report expressing a limited assurance conclusion on:\n\n- the compliance of the Statement with the requirements of article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code;\n- the fairness of the information provided pursuant to part 3 of sections I and II of Article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code, i.e. the outcomes of policies, including key performance indicators, and measures relating to the main risks.\n\nAs we are engaged to form an independent conclusion on the Information as prepared by management, we are not permitted to be involved in the preparation of the Information as doing so may compromise our independence.\n\nIt is not our responsibility to report on:\n\n- the Lacroix Group's compliance with other applicable legal and regulatory requirements, in particular the information set-out in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (green taxonomy), the French duty of care law and anti-corruption and tax avoidance legislation.\n- the fairness of the information set-out in Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (green taxonomy)\n- the compliance of products and services with the applicable regulations.\n\n#### **Applicable regulatory provisions and professional guidance**\n\nWe performed the work described below in accordance with Articles A. 225-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes) applicable to such engagement, in particular the professional guidance issued by the Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes, Intervention du commissaire aux comptes – Intervention de l'OTI – Déclaration de performance extra-financière, our own procedures (Programme de verification de la déclaration de performance extra-financière, July 7th 2023) acting as the verification programme and with the international standard ISAE 3000 (revised).\n\n#### **Independence and quality control**\n\nOur independence is defined by the provisions of Article L. 823-10 of the French Commercial Code and French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors\n\n(Code de déontologie) of our profession. In addition, we have implemented a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures aimed at ensuring compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, ethical requirements and the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes) relating to this engagement.\n\n#### **Means and resources**\n\nOur verification work mobilized the skills of three people and took place between January 2024 and February 2024 on a total duration of intervention of about four weeks.\n\nWe were assisted in our work by our specialists in sustainable development and corporate social responsibility. We conducted three interviews with the people responsible for preparing the Statement, representing in particular risk management, compliance, human resources, and environmental departments.\n\n#### **Nature and scope of the work**\n\nWe are required to plan and perform our work to address the areas where we have identified that a material misstatement of the Information is likely to arise.\n\nThe procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment. In carrying out our limited assurance engagement on the Information:\n\n- we obtained an understanding of all the consolidated entities' activities and the description of the main risks associated;\n- we assessed the suitability of the criteria of the Guidelines with respect to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and understandability, with due consideration of industry best practices, where appropriate;\n- we verified that the Statement includes each category of social and environmental information set out in Article L. 225 102 1 III of the French Commercial Code as well as information regarding compliance with human rights and anti-corruption and tax avoidance legislation and includes, where applicable, an explanation of the reasons for the absence of the information required under Article L. 225- 102-1 III, paragraph 2 of the French Commercial Code;\n- we verified that the Statement provides the information required under Article R.225-105 II of the French Commercial Code where relevant with respect to the main risks;\n\n*(1) ISAE 3000 (révisé) Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information*\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\n- we verified that the Statement presents the business model and a description of the main risks associated with all the consolidated entities' activities, including where relevant and proportionate, the risks associated with its their business relationships, its their products or services, as well as their policies, measures and the outcomes thereof, including key performance indicators associated to the main risks;\n- we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to\n\n• assess the process used to identify and confirm the main risks as well as the consistency of the outcomes, including the key performance indicators used, with respect to the main risks and the policies presented, and\n\n• corroborate the qualitative information (measures and outcomes) that we considered to be the most important presented in Appendix 1; concerning certain risks (eco design, impact products, ethics and compliance), our work was carried out on the consolidating Lacroix Group, for the others risks, our work was carried out on the consolidating Lacroix Group and on a selection of entities : Lacroix Baupréau, Lacroix Zriba\n\n• we verified that the Statement covers the scope of consolidation, i.e. all the consolidated entities in accordance with article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code within the limitations set out in the Statement;\n\n- we obtained an understanding of internal control and risk management procedures the Lacroix Group has implemented and assessed the data collection process aimed at ensuring the completeness and fairness of the Information;\n- for the key performance indicators and other quantitative outcomes that we considered to be the most important presented in Appendix 1, we implemented:\n\n• analytical procedures to verify the proper consolidation of the data collected and the consistency of any changes in those data;\n\n• tests of details, using sampling techniques, in order to verify the proper application of the definitions and procedures and reconcile the data with the supporting documents. This work was carried out on a selection of contributing entities and covers between 20% and 34% of the consolidated data relating to the key performance indicators and outcomes selected for these tests (34% of energy consumption, 20% of headcount);\n\n• we assessed the overall consistency of the Statement in relation to our knowledge of all the consolidated entities.\n\nThe procedures performed in a basis for our limited assurance conclusion review are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance opinion in accordance with the professional guidelines of the French National Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes); a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures.\n\nParis-La Défense, the 26 March 2024 French original signed by:\n\n#### **Independent third party EY & Associés**\n\nChristophe Schmeitzky Partner, Sustainable Development\n\n*La CNCC considère que la traduction n'est pas signée, dans la mesure où il s'agit d'une traduction libre en anglais du rapport original établi en français.

**STATUTORY AUDITORS' REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**\n\n#### **LACROIXGroup**\n\nYear ended 31 December 2023\n\nTo the General Meeting of Shareholders of Lacroix Group,\n\n## **Opinion**\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your general meeting of shareholders, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Lacroix Group for the accounting period ended 31 December 2023.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2023 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n### **Basis for Opinion**\n\n#### **Audit Framework**\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n#### **Independence**\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors (Code de déontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes) for the period from 1 January 2023 to the date of our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014.\n\n## **Justification of Assessments – Key Audit Matters**\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 821 53 and R. 821-180 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### **Measurement of the recoverable amount of goodwill**\n\n#### **Risk identified**\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the net value of goodwill is €83,506k.\n\nAs stated in Note 6.4.4 \"Business combinations\" to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is subject to an impairment test at least once a year and more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired.\n\nImpairment tests are carried out at the level of the Cash Generating Units (CGUs). They consist in comparing the carrying amount of a CGU to its recoverable amount.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the goodwill of each CGU defined by your group is determined based on future cash flows calculated for five-year periods, a discount rate of 9% for the City and Environment CGUs and 9.4% for the Electronics CGU, and a perpetual growth rate of 2% as stated in Note 8.1 \"Goodwill\" to the consolidated financial statements. The measurement of the recoverable amount of goodwill is a key audit matter due to the materiality of goodwill in relation to your group's financial statements and the use of assumptions and estimates to make this assessment.\n\n{83}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Our response**\n\nWe analyzed the key data and assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill, by including a valuation specialist in our audit team to perform these various analyses: We:\n\n- We assessed the operational assumptions adopted to establish the cash flow projections, notably by comparing them to past actual figures and market prospects.\n- reviewed the reconciliation of the business plans used for the impairment tests with the budgets approved by the Management;\n- examined the methods used to determine the discount rate and the perpetual growth rate and their consistency with the underlying market assumptions;\n- tested the mathematical accuracy of the models and recalculated the amounts.\n\nLastly, we assessed the appropriateness of the information disclosed in Notes 6.4.4 \"Business combinations\" and 8.1 \"Goodwill\" to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### **Measurement and presentation of the impacts of the ongoing planned sale of the Signaling BU**\n\n#### **Risk identified**\n\nAs announced on 9 February 2023, your Group intends to sell its Signaling BU and announced on 14 December 2023 that it was in exclusive negotiations with AIAC for this takeover.\n\nAs stated in Note 6.5.16 \"Assets and groups of assets held for sale and abandoned activities\" to the consolidated financial statements, all of the assets and the liabilities related to the abandoned activities or businesses held for sale are presented on a separate line of assets and liabilities, as they would appear upon sale after elimination of the intragroup positions.\n\nNote 7.3.2 \"Planned sale of the Signaling BU\" sets out your Group's analysis of the nature of the assets and liabilities being transferred with regard to IFRS 5, and presents the main financial impacts on your Group's consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2023. In light of the estimated value of the sale, the historic goodwill of the Signaling BU has been fully impaired, as has a share of non-current assets for a total amount of €3,735k.\n\nWe considered this to be a key audit matter in view of the amounts involved, the unusual nature of the transaction and the use of assumptions and estimates for this valuation\n\n#### **Our response**\n\nWe analyzed the data and key assumptions used for the valuation and presentation of the assets\n\nand liabilities to be sold. Our work consisted in the following in particular:\n\n- familiarizing ourselves with the analysis performed by your Group to characterize the transaction in view of the provisions of IFRS 5 ;\n- analyzing the identification and measurement of the assets and liabilities to be sold in view of the provisions of IFRS 5.\n\nLastly, we assessed the appropriateness of the information disclosed in Notes 6.5.16 \"Assets and groups of assets held for sale and abandoned activities\" and 7.3.2 \"Planned sale of the Signaling BU\" to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## **Specific Verifications**\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations of the information relating to the Group given in the Board of Directors' management report.\n\nWe have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe attest that the consolidated non-financial statement required by Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) is included in the information relating to the Group given in the management report, it being specified that, in accordance with Article L. 823-10 of this Code, we have verified neither the fair presentation nor the consistency with the consolidated financial statements of the information contained in this statement.\n\n## **Other Verifications or Information Required by Laws and Regulations**\n\n#### **Format of presentation of the consolidated financial statements included in the annual financial report**\n\nIn accordance with the professional standard applicable in France relating to the procedures performed by statutory auditors regarding the annual and consolidated financial statements prepared in the European single electronic format, we have also verified that the preparation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L. 451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code monétaire et financier), prepared under the CEO's responsibility, complies with the single electronic format defined in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2019/815 of 17 December 2018. As it relates to the consolidated financial statements, our work includes verifying that the tagging in the financial statements complies with the format defined in the aforementioned Regulation.\n\n{84}------------------------------------------------\n\nOn the basis of our work, we conclude that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the consolidated annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nDue to the technical limitations inherent in the block-tagging of consolidated financial statements in the European single electronic format, it is possible that the content of certain tagging in our notes to the consolidated financial statements are not reproduced identically to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\n#### **Appointment of the Statutory Auditors**\n\nWe were appointed as statutory auditors of Lacroix Group by your General Meeting of Shareholders held on 11 May 2021 for MAZARS and on 18 March 2009 for ERNST & YOUNG et Autres.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, MAZARS was in its third year and ERNST & YOUNG et Autres in its fifteenth year of total uninterrupted engagement.\n\nPreviously, the firm Exco Atlantique (acquired by ERNST & YOUNG Audit and renamed ERNST & YOUNG Atlantique in 2008) was statutory auditor.\n\n### **Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures. The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n### **Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**\n\n#### **Objectives and Audit Approach**\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 821 55 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the company or the quality of management of the affairs of the company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n• Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\n{85}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements.\n- Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial\n\nstatements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.\n\n- Report to the Audit Committee\n- We submit to the Audit Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report significant deficiencies, if any, in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n- Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n- We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France as set out in particular in Articles L. 821 27 to L. 821 34 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors (Code de déontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes). Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nSaint-Herblain and Nantes, 2 April 2024\n\n**The Statutory Auditors (French original signed by)**\n\nMAZARS Arnaud Le Néen\n\nMAZARS 4, rue Edith Piaf Immeuble Asturia A 44800 Saint-Herblain S.A. à directoire et conseil de surveillance au capital de € 8 320 000 784 824 153 R.C.S.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n#### **Independence**\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors (Code de déontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes) for the period from 1 January2023 to the date of our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014.\n\n## **Justification of assessments – Key Audit Matters**\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 821-53 and R. 821-80 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\n#### **Measurement of the recoverable amount of equity securities**\n\n#### **Risk identified**\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, equity securities amount to a gross value of €85,793k and a net value of €75,793k.\n\nAs stated in Note 3.2.3 \"Financial assets\" to the financial statements, the gross value of equity securities and other long-term securities corresponds to the purchase cost excluding related expenses. A provision for impairment is recorded when the value-in-use of equity securities is less than the gross value. This value-in-use is assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the general situation and the sales and earnings outlook for each of the companies concerned, consistent with your group's development plans.\n\nWe considered that the valuation of the equity securities is a key audit matter in view of their materiality in relation to your company's financial statements and the level of judgement required to assess their value-in-use.\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Our response**\n\nWithin the scope of our audit of the financial statements, our work notably consisted in the following:\n\n- familiarizing ourselves with the valuation of the equity securities performed by your Company, the methods used and the underlying assumptions;\n- assessing the operational assumptions adopted to establish the sales and earnings forecasts for the subsidiaries by comparing them with past actual figures and market prospects.;\n- examining the consistency of the value-in-use thus determined and the recoverable amount used for the impairment tests performed on goodwill for the purposes of preparing your group's consolidated financial statements;\n- verifying the arithmetical accuracy of the valuein-use calculations performed by your company for the values deemed material.\n\n## **Specific Verifications**\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations.\n\n#### **Information given in the management report and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the shareholders**\n\nWe have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the Board of Directors' management report and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the shareholders.\n\nWe attest the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information relating to payment deadlines mentioned in Article D. 441-4 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).\n\n#### **Report on Corporate Governance**\n\nWe attest that the Board of Directors' Report on Corporate Governance sets out the information required by Articles L. 225-37-4, L. 22-10-10 and L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).\n\nConcerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of Article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to remunerations and benefits received by, or allocated to the directors and any other commitments made in their favor, we have verified its consistency with the financial statements, or\n\nwith the underlying information used to prepare these financial statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your Company from companies controlled thereby, included in the consolidation scope. Based on these procedures, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.\n\nWith respect to the information relating to items that your Company considered likely to have an impact in the event of a takeover bid or exchange offer, provided pursuant to Article L. 22-10-11 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), we have agreed this information to the source documents communicated to us. Based on these procedures, we have no observations to make on this information.\n\n#### **Other Information**\n\nIn accordance with French law, we have verified that the required information concerning the identity of the shareholders and holders of the voting rights has been properly disclosed in the management report.\n\n## **Other Verifications or Information Required by Laws and Regulations**\n\n#### **Format of presentation of the financial statements to be included in the annual financial report**\n\nWe have also verified, in accordance with the professional standard applicable in France relating to the procedures performed by statutory auditors regarding the annual and consolidated financial statements prepared in the European single electronic format, that the preparation of the financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L. 451 1 2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code monétaire et financier), prepared under the CEO's responsibility, complies with the single electronic format defined in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2019/815 of 17 December 2018.\n\nOn the basis of our work, we conclude that the preparation of the financial statements to be included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\n#### **Appointment of the Statutory Auditors**\n\nWe were appointed as statutory auditors of Lacroix Group by your General Meeting of Shareholders held on 11 May 2021 for MAZARS and on 18 March 2009 for ERNST & YOUNG et Autres.\n\nAs at 31 December 2023, MAZARS was in its third year and ERNST & YOUNG et Autres in its fifteenth year of total uninterrupted engagement.\n\n{88}------------------------------------------------\n\nPreviously, the firm Exco Atlantique (acquired by ERNST & YOUNG Audit and renamed ERNST & YOUNG Atlantique in 2008) was statutory auditor.\n\n## **Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements**\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with French accounting principles and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## **Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements**\n\n#### **Objectives and Audit Approach**\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 821 55 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control.\n- Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management in the financial statements.\n- Assesses the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- Evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Report to the Audit Committee**\n\nWe submit to the Audit Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report significant deficiencies, if any, in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France as set out in particular in Articles L. 821 27 to L. 821 34 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors (Code de déontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes). Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nSaint-Herblain and Nantes, 2 April 2024\n\n#### **Les Commissaires aux Comptes**\n\nMAZARS Arnaud Le Néen ERNST & YOUNG et Autres Stanislas de Gastines\n\nMAZARS 4, rue Edith Piaf Immeuble Asturia A 44800 Saint-Herblain S.A. à directoire et conseil de surveillance au capital de € 8 320 000 784 824 153 R.C.S.

allowance resulting from Article 158-3-2°of the French General Tax Code and applicable to natural persons residing in France.\n\nShareholders are also reminded that, in accordance with the provisions

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, CONSOLIDATION METHODS, VALUATION METHODS AND RULES**\n\n## **6.1 General information on the Company**\n\nListed on Euronext Paris, Compartment C, LACROIX Group is a public limited company under French law.\n\nThe Group's registered office is located in 17 rue Océane, 44800 Saint Herblain, France.\n\nBeyond the \"direct\" imprint of its activity, LACROIX has a societal mission, reflected in its offer, which constitutes the Group's true purpose and a permanent bond between all its employees.\n\nIts mission is to provide its customers with simple, robust technologies, helping to bring out a safer, more sustainable world.\n\nThrough its activities, LACROIX harnesses its technological know-how in order to:\n\n- Transform streets and road infrastructure into fluid, safe, and sustainable living environments. LACROIX devices guide, optimise, and safeguard the flow of vehicles and people, allowing them to share streets and roads in greater harmony, taking account of the needs of all users and operators.\n- Digitalise and optimise the management of water and energy infrastructures. Drawing on its in-depth understanding of the sector and its operator customers, LACROIX helps improve the performance of their networks, save dwindling resources, and protect the environment.\n- Design and produce electronic products in critical fields such as the automotive, aeronautical, and home automation sectors or Industry 4.0 and support their needs in automation, digitalisation, and environmental performance.\n\n## **6.2 Accounting standards**\n\n### **6.2.1 General principles**\n\nThe annual financial statements are presented for the period ended 31 December 2023 by applying all the IFRS standards published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and adopted by the European Union. All the texts adopted by the European Union are available on the website of the European Commission at the following address:\n\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/finance/accounting/ias/index\\_ fr.htm.\n\nThese methods are identical to those adopted in the consolidated financial statements on 31 December 2022.\n\nThe Group does not apply IFRS standards that have not yet been approved by the European Union as at the closing date of the period. The Group has not opted for early application of standards and interpretations whose application is not mandatory for the 2023 financial year.\n\nTexts adopted by the European Union (mandatory application for periods opening on or after 1 January 2023) and final decisions of the IFRS IC issued in 2023.\n\n- Amendment to IAS 12 removal of the exception for initial recognition of deferred tax;\n- Amendment to IAS 1 Disclosure of Accounting Policies;\n- Amendment to IAS 8 clarification of the difference between an accounting estimate and an accounting policy.\n\nThese texts and decisions of the IFRS IC have no impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\n#### **6.2.2 Presentation of the financial statements**\n\nAssets held for sale or consumption as part of the normal operating cycle, or within 12 months of closing, as well as cash and cash equivalents, are considered to be \"current assets\".\n\n\"Current liabilities\" include debts due during the normal operating cycle or within 12 months after the closing of the financial year.\n\nOther assets or liabilities are considered as \"noncurrent\".\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **6.3 Use of estimations**\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the Group's management to exercise judgement, to make estimations, and to make assumptions that have an impact on the application of the accounting methods and on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThese underlying assumptions and estimations are established and reviewed continuously based on past experience and other factors considered reasonable in the circumstances. Actual values may differ from estimated values.\n\nThe underlying assumptions and estimations are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The impact of changes in accounting estimations is recognised over the period of the change if it affects only that period or during the period of the change and any subsequent periods if these are also affected by this change.\n\n## **6.4 Basis for consolidation**\n\n#### **6.4.1 Consolidation methods**\n\nSubsidiaries of the Group:\n\n- A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls a subsidiary when it has exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary, and has the ability to use its power to affect these returns. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements as from the date on which control is obtained until the control ceases.\n- Non-controlling interests are prorated to the net identifiable assets of the acquired entity on the date of acquisition. Changes in the percentage of the Group's holding in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for equity transactions between the Group and the non-controlling interest.\n\nAssociates and joint ventures:\n\n• Associates are entities for which the Company has significant influence over financial and operating policies without having control or joint control over them. Joint ventures are partnerships that give the Group joint control, whereby it has rights regarding the net assets of the partnership and no rights regarding its assets or obligations to assume for its liabilities. Associates and joint ventures are recognised as per the equity method. The consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of the total amount of profits and losses recognised by the joint ventures and equity method companies, until the date on which the significant influence or joint control ends.\n\nMethods applied to the Group:\n\n• Based on the provisions of IFRS 11 (structure of the partnership, legal form of distinct vehicles, contractual provisions and other facts and circumstances), the Group does not have any joint ventures.\n\nThe scope of consolidation and the list of subsidiaries are provided in Note 5.\n\n#### **6.4.2 Conversion methods for foreign companies' financial statements**\n\nThe financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are converted as follows:\n\n- For the balance sheet, at the currency's exchange rate on the closing date.\n- For the income statement, at the average rate on the closing date.\n- Currency translation differences are directly recognised in shareholders' equity under \"Currency translation differences\".\n\nThe table below shows the changes to the currency parities applied:\n\n| 1ML = €X           | Opening | Average | Closing | Average<br>N-1 |\n|--------------------|---------|---------|---------|----------------|\n| Zloty (PLN)        | 0.21364 | 0.22023 | 0.23044 | 0.2134         |\n| Dollar (USD)       | 0.93756 | 0.92476 | 0.90498 | 0.94944        |\n| CFP Franc<br>(XPF) | 0.00838 | 0.00838 | 0.00838 | 0.00838        |\n| CFA Franc<br>(XAF) | 0.00152 | 0.00152 | 0.00152 | 0.00152        |\n| SG Dollar<br>(SGD) | 0.69930 | 0.68849 | 0.68535 | 0.6891         |\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recognised at the exchange rate on the day of the transaction. Gains and losses resulting from the payment of these transactions and the conversion of receivables and payables in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.\n\n#### **6.4.3 Elimination of intra-group transactions**\n\nIn accordance with the applicable regulations, balance sheet amounts and unrealised income and expenses resulting from intra-group transactions are eliminated when preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains and losses arising from transactions with associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in these associates.\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **6.4.4 Business combinations**\n\nGoodwill is subject to impairment testing performed at least once a year and more often where events or circumstances show indicators of impairment.\n\nImpairment tests are carried out at the level of the Cash Generating Units (CGUs). They consist in comparing the book value of a CGU to its recoverable value.\n\n• The recoverable value is defined as the higher of the asset's net selling price and its value in use.\n\nThe Group has adopted a testing methodology based on the DCF (Discounted Cash Flows) method using Business Plans prepared for each activity (with the activity corresponding to the notion of CGU).\n\nNote 8.1 presents the assumptions made.\n\n### **6.5 Valuation methods and rules**\n\nThe principles and methods used by the Group are as follows:\n\n#### **6.5.1 Intangible assets**\n\nIntangible assets are recognised at their acquisition cost, minus any accumulated amortisations and impairment losses, if applicable.\n\n#### **Research & Development costs**\n\nResearch expenditure is recognised as expenses.\n\nAs regards development expenses, the Group has designed a monitoring procedure to collect all useful information for identifying, valuing, and monitoring expenditure.\n\nWhere expenditures classified as development expenses meet the criteria for capitalisation, they are capitalised. Otherwise, they are recognised as expenses.\n\n#### **Amortisation and impairment**\n\nIntangible fixed assets have a finite useful life. Amortisation is recognised as an expense, on a linear basis, based on the estimated useful life of the intangible asset.\n\n|                                                                             | Duration                                                                                               |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Concessions, patents, licences                                              | Shorter of the legal period of protection or the useful life of the asset                              |\n| Software                                                                    | When capitalisable, from 3 to 10 years                                                                 |\n|                                                                             | Duration                                                                                               |\n| Land improvements                                                           | 7 to 30 years                                                                                          |\n| Buildings for operations                                                    | 25 to 50 years                                                                                         |\n| Building installations and<br>fixtures of properties owned by<br>the Group  | 15 to 40 years                                                                                         |\n| Building installations and<br>fixtures of properties rented by<br>the Group | Shorter of the term of the lease<br>(including potential renewals)<br>and the useful life of the asset |\n| Equipment and tools                                                         | 8 to 15 years                                                                                          |\n| Transportation equipment                                                    | 5 years                                                                                                |\n| Office equipment and furniture                                              | 3 to 15 years                                                                                          |\n\nThey are subject to impairment testing where there is an indicator of impairment.\n\n• Indefinite-life intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing. Impairment tests are based on discounted future cash flows.\n\n#### **6.5.2 Tangible assets**\n\n#### **Non-current tangible assets**\n\nTangible assets are valued at their acquisition cost, minus any accumulated amortisations and impairment, or at their production costs for the part produced by the Group.\n\nWhere a tangible asset has significant components with different useful lives, these components are recognised separately.\n\n#### **Amortisation and impairment**\n\nAmortisation is recognised as an expense, on a linear basis, based on the estimated useful life of the tangible asset.\n\nThe amortisation periods used are as follows:\n\nThe book values of tangible assets are subject to impairment testing where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value may not be recoverable. Thus, if the book value of a tangible asset is higher than its estimated recoverable value, an impairment loss is recognised for this asset.\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **6.5.3 Lease contracts**\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 16, when a lease contract is entered into, the Group must record a liability in the balance sheet corresponding to the discounted future payments of the fixed portion of the lease payments, in exchange for rights of use of the asset amortised over the duration of the contract.\n\nIn accordance with the exemptions provided for by this standard, the Group excludes contracts with a residual duration of less than 12 months and contracts relating to low-value assets (less than \\$5K).\n\nThe amount of the liability is significantly dependent on the assumptions made regarding the duration of the obligations and, to a lesser extent, the discount rate.\n\nThe duration of the contract generally used to calculate the liability is the duration of the contract initially negotiated, without taking into account early termination or extension options, except in special cases.\n\nIn accordance with the decision made by the IFRS Interpretation Committee (\"IFRS IC\") when the rental commitment is less than 12 months but assets have been capitalised in relation to this contract, the Group records a lease liability over a period consistent with the expected useful life of the invested assets.\n\nThe standard requires the discount rate for each contract to be determined by reference to the marginal borrowing rate of the contracting subsidiary. In practice, the marginal borrowing rate generally used is the sum of the risk-free rate by reference to its duration, a currency swap where applicable, the Group's credit risk, and a possible surcharge depending on the nature of the asset financed.\n\n#### **6.5.4 Financial assets**\n\nNon-current financial assets include investment securities and financial loans and receivables with a maturity of more than twelve months.\n\n- Investment securities are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.\n- Their fair value is measured on the basis of the stock market price on the closing date for listed securities. For unlisted securities, in the absence of specific events, their acquisition cost or share of net worth is considered the best possible estimate of fair value.\n- Financial loans and receivables are classified as assets generated by the business. They are valued at amortised cost. They are subject to a provision for depreciation as soon as there is an indication of impairment.\n\n#### **6.5.5 Financial risk management**\n\nForeign currency and interest rate hedging:\n\n• Hedging transactions are analysed by an independent expert in order to ensure that they comply with IAS 32 and IFRS 9 when they are of a significant nature.\n\n#### **6.5.6 Inventories and goods in progress**\n\nInventory and goods in progress are valued at the lowest point of their cost and their net realisable value. Cost is measured using the weighted average cost method. This cost includes the costs of materials and direct labour as well as indirect expenses strictly attributable to production.\n\nInternal margins included in inventories are eliminated in the consolidated financial statement.\n\nProvisions for impairment are calculated based on the difference between the gross value determined according to the principles described above and the probable net realisable value.\n\n#### **6.5.7 Trade accounts receivable**\n\nTrade accounts receivable and related accounts are valued at their fair value. Since accounts receivable are due within one year, they are not discounted. A provision for impairment is recognised, if necessary, depending on the likelihood of recovery at the closing date.\n\nThe Group, at the initiative of some of its main partner customers, has implemented reverse factoring contracts. The substantial analysis of these reverse factoring contracts set out in IFRS 9 confirmed that the 3 main de-recognition criteria applicable in particular to disposals of receivables were met, namely:\n\n- The expiry or transfer of the contractual rights over cash flows relating to the asset,\n- The transfer of almost all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the asset (credit risk due to the debtor's insolvency, carry trade risk inherent to payment deferral/delay compared to the normal due date, and risk of dilution resulting mainly from litigations and settlement differences (credit notes, compensation, etc.),\n- The loss of asset control.\n\n#### **6.5.8 Cash and cash equivalents**\n\n\"Cash in hand\" includes bank balances and easily liquid investments.\n\nBank overdrafts are included in borrowings among short-term debts in the balance sheet liabilities.\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **6.5.9 Capital and reserves**\n\nWhen the Group buys back or sells treasury shares:\n\n- The price paid including expenses incurred for their acquisition net of tax is deducted from shareholders' equity under \"Treasury shares\" until their disposal.\n- When they are sold, the capital gain or loss is recognised in shareholders' equity.\n\n#### **6.5.10 Public grants**\n\nGrants are included in the financial statements, where there is reasonable assurance that:\n\n- The Group will comply with the conditions attached to the financing.\n- The grants will be received.\n- For public grants attached to assets, the Group has elected to present the financing as a deduction from the value of the related asset.\n\n#### **6.5.11 Provisions for other liabilities and charges**\n\nWhere the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) arising from a past event and if it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and if the obligation can be reliably estimated, the Group then recognises a provision.\n\n#### **6.5.12 Employee benefits**\n\nRetirement benefits:\n\n- The Group recognises a provision for retirement benefits, based on collective agreements. This is a defined benefit plan. The provision is valued by an independent actuary. Note 8.11.1 presents the assumptions made.\n- These valuations take into account in particular the future compensation level, the probable active life of employees, life expectancy, and staff turnover.\n- The present value of commitments as thus valued is recognised in the balance sheet, after deduction of the fair value of assets paid by companies of the Group to financial institutions.\n- Actuarial gains and losses, arising mainly from changes in actuarial assumptions and the difference between results estimated based on the actuarial assumptions and the actual results, are recognised to the full extent in shareholders' equity.\n- The financial cost and the cost of services rendered are recognised as an expense for the financial year.\n\n#### Share-based payments:\n\n- Share subscription or purchase option plans granted to employees must be valued at their fair value, that must be charged to the income statement with a corresponding entry for reserves over the vesting period (2 to 4 years) for employees.\n- The fair value of options is calculated using the Black & Scholes model. The cost is thus charged over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in reserves.\n- The fair value of bonus shares is calculated using the binomial model to take into account performance-related conditions.\n\n#### **6.5.13 Borrowings**\n\nBorrowings are initially recognised at their fair value, net of the related commissions.\n\nThe portion of financial debts falling due within one year is classified as current financial debts.\n\n#### **6.5.14 Commitments to purchase noncontrolling interests**\n\nNon-controlling shareholders of some fully consolidated subsidiaries benefit from commitments to purchase their shares granted by the Group.\n\nThe Group recognises these commitments as follows:\n\n- the value of the commitment on the closing date is shown under \"Amounts due for business combinations\";\n- the commitment is recognised with a corresponding entry for Group share shareholders' equity;\n- subsequent variations are recognised as shareholders' equity, including the effects of financial discounting.\n- When a condition of presence is attached to these instruments, the group recognises an expense in the income statement for this specific part of the instrument, spread over the contractual period of presence.\n\n#### **6.5.15 Current and deferred taxes**\n\nA deferred tax amount is calculated for all existing temporary differences between the book value reflected in the consolidated balance sheet and the tax value of assets and liabilities.\n\nThe taxation rate used is that which the Group expects to pay or recover from the tax authorities and which has been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. As such, the Group has used the rate of 25% for the calculation of its deferred taxes in France.\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\nCurrent and differed tax assets and liabilities are not discounted and are classified in the balance sheet as non-current assets and liabilities.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that these taxes will be recovered over future financial years.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset for the same tax entity. The Group has two tax consolidation groups, one in France (headed by LACROIX Group) and the other in Spain (headed by LACROIX Sofrel Espana).\n\nDetails of these tax groups are given in note 5.\n\nTax rate by country:\n\n|               | Period 2023 |\n|---------------|-------------|\n| Germany       | 30.0%       |\n| United States | 21.0%       |\n| Spain         | 25.0%       |\n| France        | 25.0%       |\n| Italy         | 27.9%       |\n| Poland        | 19.0%       |\n| Tunisia       | 10.0%       |\n\n#### **6.5.16 Assets and groups of assets held for sale and discontinued operations**\n\nA discontinued operation is either a component of an entity from which it has separated or an operation classified as held for sale and:\n\n- which represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operation;\n- which is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or major geographical area of operation; or\n- which is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to be resold.\n\nAn operation is classified as discontinued only when the entity has disposed of the operation or at an earlier date when the operation meets the criteria for being classified as held for sale. When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative income statement and cash flow statement are restated as if the operation had met the criteria of a discontinued operation as from the date of opening of the comparative period.\n\nFurthermore, all assets and liabilities linked to discontinued operations or those held for sale are presented on a separate line of the assets and liabilities, as they would appear for a disposal after elimination of intra-group positions.\n\nDetails of businesses being sold are given in note 7.3.2\n\n#### **6.5.17 Revenue**\n\nRevenue from sales of goods and services is recognised once control of the goods or services has been transferred to the customer.\n\nDepending on the different revenue flows of the Group and, where necessary, the specifics of each contract, control is transferred either at a point in time or over the time.\n\nWhen it is established that the Group fulfils its performance obligations to customers on a progressive basis, the Group recognises revenue progressively by the cost approach.\n\nThe amounts recognised as revenue are based on the transaction prices stipulated in the contract for the amount of the consideration the Group expects to receive pursuant to contract clauses.\n\nThe transaction prices stipulated in contracts have no significant variable portions requiring estimations to be used. Group contracts do not stipulate payment deadlines of more than one year, and no financing component is recorded in this respect.\n\n#### **6.5.18 Earnings per share**\n\nBasic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, excluding shares bought by the Company and held as treasury shares.\n\nDiluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period adjusted for the conversion of dilutive instruments into ordinary shares.\n\nThe group has dilutive instruments, bonus shares.\n\n#### **6.5.19 Segment reporting**\n\nThe Group's segment reporting is based on the concept of business segments. The choice of this level and its breakdown reflects the Group's organisational structure and the risk and profitability differences.\n\n- Electronics Activity\n- Environment Activity\n- City Activity\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **7. COMPARABILITY OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE PERIOD**\n\n## **7.1 Accounting changes**\n\nNone\n\n## **7.2 Changes in consolidation scope and entry of minority shareholders**\n\nNone\n\n## **7.3 Significant events**\n\n#### **7.3.1 Key events of the period**\n\n#### **Cyberattack**\n\nOn 15 May 2023, LACROIX announced it had suffered a cyberattack which mainly affected the French (Beaupréau), German (Willich) and Tunisian (Zriba) sites of the Electronics activity.\n\nThe main financial impacts of the cyber attack on the Group's financials are as follows:\n\n- The operating loss incurred amounts to €1.8M and is covered by the insurance policy;\n- Non recurring costs of €0.6M have been recognised as \"Other operating income and expenses\" (see 8.17).\n\n#### **Sale of the Saint Herblain building**\n\nLacroix City Saint Herblain sold its business building on 22 December 2023 then leased it back under a commercial lease. This sale and leaseback transaction was specifically restated according to IFRS 16, leading to the recognition of a consolidated capital gain of €2,360K. The impact of this restatement is detailed in note 8.4 - Leases.\n\n#### **LACROIX Electronics MI**\n\nThe year-end inventory review of the LACROIX Electronics MI (Ex-Firstronic) sites revealed counting and values differences of \\$3.3 M, in operating profits. Investigations were carried out to identify the origin of the deviations, their causes and the associated corrective action plans. Internal control deficiencies have prevented us from reconstructing all of these discrepancies. In particular, the dates of origin of the discrepancies cannot be broken down with sufficient reliability.\n\n#### **7.3.2 Proposed sale of the Signalisation BU**\n\nFor the record, in its annual sales press release dated 9 February 2023, LACROIX announced its intention to divest its Signalisation Business Unit (called \"BU\") (8% of LACROIX' turnover) in order to focus its investments on its strategic markets around industrial IoT and electronic equipment.\n\nFollowing this announcement, the Signalisation BU embarked on a gradual process of empowerment in preparation for the sale.\n\nOn 14 December 2023, LACROIX Group announced that it had entered into exclusive negotiations with AIAC with a view to acquiring this BU.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, in view of this planned disposal and in accordance with IFRS 5 - Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, the Signalisation Business Unit is presented in the consolidated financial statements as an asset being sold. The impact of reclassifications resulting from the application of this standard is presented in the \"Assets of activities held for sale\" column in the detailed tables in these notes. Assets held for sale include the historical goodwill of the Signalisation BU.\n\nGiven the estimated value of the disposal, a capital loss of €3,735K was recognised. Goodwill was fully written down, as was a share of non-current assets in the same amount.\n\nOn 18 March 2024, LACROIX announced the sale of the Signalisation BU (see Note 9.6 - Post-balance sheet events).\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe table below details the impact of the disposal on the balance sheet, as well as the assets and liabilities classified as

overdrafts\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe impact of this disposal is recognised in the income statement under \"Other operating income and expenses\" (see 8.17).\n\nAs the Signalisation Business Unit does not meet the definition of a discontinued operation under IFRS 5, the result of this BU in the process of being sold being sold is not isolated in the published income statement.\n\nThe Signalisation BU's main aggregates in the Group's consolidated financial statements break down as follows:\n\n| In €K   | Period 2023 | Period 2022 |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|\n| Revenue | 58,320      | 54,559      |\n| EBITDA  | 2,921       | (1,285)     |\n| EBIT    | 1,157       | (3,039)     |\n\nThe Signalisation BU also contributes to the amortisation of certain structural costs.\n\nIn addition, the profit or loss for the intervening period (from 1 January 2024 to the effective disposal date) and the change in net

When there is a material deviation, it is analysed to determine whether it is a one-off or structural deviation and is also re-contextualised according to the overall plan approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nA reasonably possible change (in the order of 0.5 percentage points) in the discount rates or COI would not lead to an impairment of the Group's goodwill.\n\n## **8.2 Intangible

process of allocating the acquisition price of Lacroix Electronics MI in 2021.\n\nThe difficulties encountered by Lacroix Electronics MI (including the rise in payroll costs and the sharp appreciation of the Mexican peso, the loss of productivity resulting in particular from saturation of production capacity before the opening of the new Juarez site), had a significant impact on the company's EBITDA and led to a review of the assumptions used for the valuation of the \"customer list\" asset. As a result, an exceptional writeoff of €10,814k was recognised.\n\n{116}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **8.3 Tangible assets**\n\n|

obtained in 2021 has been fully offset against the tax due in 2023.\n\n(2) Losses carried forward correspond to the capitalised tax loss bases of the French tax group for €20.2M, of LACROIX Electronics MI for €10.6M and LACROIX Electronics Beaupreau for €5.2M.\n\n(3) This concerns both deferred taxes on \"customer relationships\" recognised in intangible assets, which diminish as these intangible assets are amortised in the accounts (see 8.2), and deferred tax liabilities that the group recognises on tax deductible goodwill in the United States and Germany.\n\n(\\*) After an overall analysis of net deferred tax assets and liabilities by nature, this item takes into account the obligation to present deferred taxes in net value, within the scope of the tax consolidation group (Note 6.5.15).\n\n{128}------------------------------------------------\n\n## **9. OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n## **9.1 Degree of exposure of the Group to financial risks**\n\n#### **9.1.1 Currency risk**\n\nOther than the Electronics Activity, the Group is not exposed to currency variation risks.\n\nIn the Electronics business, the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk, mainly with regard to component purchases, which are often denominated in USD or JPY, as well as other payroll costs and/or service purchases invoiced in TND, MXN and PLN.\n\nAs regards purchases in USD and JPY, the Company has contracts with its main customers enabling it to adjust the selling price of products according to changes in the EUR/USD exchange rate. Therefore, the currency risk for this item is under control. For the balance, the Company uses partial hedging of its needs to cover a target rate set each fiscal year. Purchases in USD and JPY amount to approximately €70 million annually, 80% of which is passed on to customers through contracts. For the remaining part, exchange rate hedging is carried out to secure a \"budget\" rate.\n\nExpenditure in TND, MXN and PLN (around €75 million) mainly concerns salaries and social charges for employees at the Tunisian, Mexican and Polish sites, and some local purchases. The Group's policy is to carry out forward hedging on the basis of forecast requirements, enabling a \"budget\" rate to be covered (one-year horizon). Changes in labour costs are also factored into the new commercial offers.\n\nGenerally speaking, the use of financial instruments is strictly limited to business requirements, and excludes any speculative activities.\n\nIn addition, specifically on financing activities, at the end of 2021 the group set up Cross Currency Swap (CCS) instruments in USD on a €30M loan.\n\n#### **9.1.2 Interest rate risk**\n\nNote 8.12.3 on \"Borrowings and financial debts\" shows that out of €103,844K of debt, €54,079K are at a fixed rate and €49,765K are at a variable rate.\n\nThe Group implements various financial instruments with several maturities to mitigate this risk. At the end of December 2023, the portion of financing at variable rates hedged by CAP, SWAP, COLLAR is 67% of the nominal value. 84% of total debt (variable and fixed rate) is hedged.\n\n#### **9.1.3 Liquidity risk**\n\nGross debt position for the Group amounts to €157,086K. Available cash amounts to €42,523K. The Group therefore considers its exposure to this risk to be low.\n\n#### **9.1.4 Credit risk**\n\nEach of the Group's activities has implemented a system for monitoring and managing customer risk, sometimes using credit insurance contracts for this purpose to protect from potential customer risk.\n\nCustomer profiles by sector of activity are described below:\n\n| Activities  | Main customer types                                                   |\n|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Electronics | French and foreign companies operating internationally                |\n| Environment | Public bodies and major water and electricity management stakeholders |\n| City        | Government authorities and major public works companies               |\n\n{129}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **9.1.5 Financial gearing**\n\nThe Group closely monitors its capital by controlling changes in its gearing.\n\n|                                          | Period 2023 | Period 2022 |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Borrowings and other financial debts     | 127,015     | 114,655     |\n| Bank overdrafts                          | 30,070      | 48,393      |\n| Other net financial debts                | (1,634)     | (1,638)     |\n| Cash and cash equivalents (see Note 8.9) | (42,523)    | (22,613)    |\n| Net debt position (1)                    | 112,928     | 138,797     |\n| Shareholders' equity                     | 190,057     | 193,885     |\n| Financial gearing                        | 59.4%       | 71.6%       |\n\n(1) Amounts due for business combinations are not included in the Group's gearing ratio.\n\n#### **9.1.6 Classification of financial assets and liabilities at fair value based on fair value levels**\n\nIFRS 13 (Fair Value Measurement) imposes a fair value hierarchy for financial instruments (the inputs to valuation techniques). The inputs are categorised as follows:\n\nLevel 1: direct reference to quoted (unadjusted) prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n\nLevel 2: a valuation technique that uses asset or liability inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly;\n\nLevel 3: valuation technique based on unobservable inputs.\n\n#### As at 31/12/2023\n\n| ASSETS                                                        | Amortized cost | Fair value<br>measured<br>through OCI | Fair value<br>measured<br>through P&L |

APPENDIX**\n\n## **3.1 Major events of the financial year**\n\n#### Cyberattack:\n\nOn 15 May 2023, LACROIX announced it had suffered a cyberattack which mainly affected the French (Beaupréau), German (Willich) and Tunisian (Zriba) sites of the Electronics activity.\n\nThe main financial impacts of the cyber attack on the Group's accounts are as follows:\n\n- Loss of revenue estimated at between €4M and €5M\n- The operating loss incurred amounts to €1.8M and is covered by the insurance company\n- Other exceptional costs totalled €0.6M, €0.3M of which was borne by LACROIX GROUP\n\n#### Proposed sale of the Road Signs BU:\n\nFor the record, in its annual sales press release dated 9 February 2023, LACROIX announced its intention to divest its Signalisation segment (8% of LACROIX' turnover) in order to focus its investments on its strategic markets around industrial IoT and electronic equipment.\n\nFollowing this announcement, the Signalisation BU embarked on a gradual process of empowerment in preparation for the sale.\n\nOn 14 December 2023, LACROIX Group announced that it had entered into exclusive negotiations with AIAC with a view to acquiring this BU.\n\n#### Other facts\n\nLACROIX GROUP has concluded a new loan agreement with LACROIX North America, dated on 7 June 2023. The loan amonts to \\$5,277K.\n\n### **3.2 Accounting principles and methods**\n\nFrench accounting regulations and methods have been applied in compliance with the prudence principle, in line with fundamental assumptions concerning:\n\n- business continuity,\n- consistency of accounting methods from one financial year to another,\n- independence of financial years,\n\nand in accordance with the general regulations on drawing up and presenting annual financial statements in keeping with the French Accounting Standards Authority (ANC) regulation no. 2016- 07 relating to French generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nThe basic method used to evaluate elements recorded in the accounts is the historical cost method.\n\n#### **Changes in accounting, evaluation, and estimation methods**\n\nNone\n\nThe main methods used are as follows:\n\n### **3.2.1 Intangible assets**\n\nIntangible assets are valued at their acquisition cost and are amortised using the straight-line method:\n\n- Concessions, patents, licenses, software - 1 to 10 years,\n- Research & Development costs 3 to 5 years.\n\n#### **3.2.2 Tangible assets**\n\nTangible assets are valued at their acquisition cost (purchase price and related expenses, other than expenses incurred in asset acquisition) or at their production cost. Interest on loans specific to asset production are not included in the cost of production of these assets.\n\nAmortisations are calculated using the straight-line method according to expected used full:\n\n- Installations and fittings 9 to 30 years,\n- Office IT equipment 3 to 6 years,\n- Furniture 15 years.\n\n#### **3.2.3 Financial assets**\n\nThe gross value of investment securities and other long-term investments corresponds to the purchase cost excluding related expenses. Receivables from investments and loans are valued at their historical cost.\n\nA provision for impairment is created where the value in use of investment securities is lower than the gross value. This value in use is assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking particular account of the general situation, business prospects, results of each of the companies concerned, and in line with the Group's development plans.\n\n{140}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **3.2.4 Receivables**\n\nReceivables are valued at their nominal value. A provision for impairment is created where the carrying value of investment securities is lower than the book value.\n\n#### **3.2.5 Short-term deposits**\n\nTheir gross value corresponds to the purchase cost excluding related expenses. Where the carrying value corresponding to the closing price is lower than the gross value, a provision for impairment is recorded at closing.\n\nStock options are recorded in the accounts as shortterm deposits.\n\n#### **3.2.6 Foreign currency transactions**\n\nForeign currency expenses and income are recorded at their counter value in the reference currency on the transaction date. Currency liabilities, receivables, and cash equivalents are shown on the balance sheet at their counter value at the end of the financial year.\n\nThe difference resulting from revaluation of currency liabilities and receivables at the latter rate is included in the balance sheet under \"Currency translation differences\". Unrealised exchange losses not compensated are included in a provision for other liabilities.\n\n#### **3.2.7 Provisions for other liabilities and charges**\n\nProvisions for other liabilities and charges are created to take account of the Company's obligations to third parties, which are likely or certain to cause a release of resources in favour of such third parties, without at least equivalent compensation, and for which the due date or amount is not precisely fixed. They are valued by taking account of the information available and, where applicable, after consultation with the Company's experts and advisers.\n\nThe amount recorded in respect of the provision for retirement has been valued using the actuarial method known as the \"accruals basis\" and also referred to as the \"retrospective method of projected credit units\". No differed tax asset was recorded in this respect.\n\nSince the closing of the 2013/2014 financial year, the Company has applied the ANC R 2013- 02 recommendation. The Company has opted for method no. 2, which allows actuarial differences to be treated using the corridor method. This method involves recording actuarial differences included in the corridor as off-sheet balance commitments and amortising in the results those outside the corridor.\n\n#### **3.2.8 Extraordinary income**\n\nExtraordinary income includes elements of income not related to the ordinary activities of the Company.\n\nIt also include elements which, while related to ordinary activities, are exceptional in terms of their amounts and their occurrence.\n\n#### **3.2.9 Taxes on profits**\n\nLACROIX Group (the Group's parent company) and its integrated subsidiaries (all over 95% owned) decided to adopt the tax group regime for groups provided for under Articles 223 A et seq. of the French General Tax Code (CGI), on the date of 27 September 1996, for 5 years as of 1 October 1996. Since 1 October 2001, the option of tax consolidation has been subject to renewal by tacit agreement.\n\nThe tax covered by subsidiaries is the tax they would have incurred in the absence of tax consolidation, the parent company recognising in profit or loss the provisional or definitive tax differentials arising from the application of the regime.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the tax scope includes the following entities:\n\n| List of subsidiaries        | Registered office   |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------|\n| LACROIX Electronics         | BEAUPREAU-EN-MAUGES
