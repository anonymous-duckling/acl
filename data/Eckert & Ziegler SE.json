In the reporting period, training focused on the topics of sustainability and risk analysis. These included, in particular, the regulatory requirements of CSRD/ ESRS, materiality analysis and taxonomy reporting. In the area of risk analysis, extensive and practice-oriented training was provided on scenario analysis, Monte Carlo simulation and risk aggregation with the aim of using the results of a simulation to weigh up risk and return and carry out a riskappropriate assessment.\n\n### **Nomination Committee**\n\nThe members of the Nomination Committee are\n\n- Dr Edgar Löffler\n- Frank Perschmann\n\nThe **Nomination Committee** held nine meetings in 2023. It dealt in detail with the restructuring of the Executive Board as of June 2023 and the changes to the Supervisory Board. In the second half of the year, the Nomination Committee worked on the termination of the Executive Board contract with Dr Hakim Bouterfa. In addition, a plan was initiated for the development of the Executive Board from 2025 onwards and the following years.\n\nThe Supervisory Board was kept regularly and comprehensively informed about the work of the committees.\n\n### **CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES**\n\nIn the period under review, the Supervisory Board continued to deal with the further development of the standards of good and responsible corporate governance, taking into account the German Corporate Governance Code as amended on April 28, 2022.

KG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft Steuerberatungsgesellschaft, Berlin, Germany. The auditor has concluded that all legal requirements have been met and has granted an unqualified auditor's opinion. Furthermore, the auditor has concluded that the Executive Board has implemented the measures incumbent upon it pursuant to Section 91 (2) of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, AktG) regarding the establishment of a risk-monitoring system in a suitable form and that this system is suitable for the early detection of developments that endanger the continued existence of the company as a going concern.

A representative of the auditor took part in the Supervisory Board's balance-sheet meeting on 19 March 2024 and reported on the key findings of the audit. The Supervisory Board acknowledged and approved the auditor's results.\n\nBased on its subsequent examination, the Supervisory Board raises no objections against the audited annual financial statements, the combined management report and the affiliated company report, including the Executive Board's concluding statement. The Supervisory Board therefore approved the annual financial statements of Eckert & Ziegler Strahlenund Medizintechnik AG and the consolidated financial statements of the Eckert & Ziegler Group. The annual financial statements of Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG are thereby adopted. The Supervisory Board concurs with the Executive Board's recommendation\\* on the appropriation of net profit.\n\n### **PERSONNEL CHANGES IN THE EXECUTIVE BOARD AND SUPERVISORY BOARD**\n\nProf Dr Wolfgang Maennig stepped down from the Supervisory Board of Eckert & Ziegler AG at the end of the Annual General Meeting on June 7, 2023. Since 7 June 2023, the company's founder, Dr Andreas Eckert, has been the new Chairman of the Supervisory Board. At the end of November 2023, Dr Andreas Eckert announced that he would resign from the Supervisory Board in spring 2024 in order to join the Executive Board of Pentixapharm AG and support the announced split-off. In light of the planned split-off of Pentixapharm AG, Dr Hakim Bouterfa, responsible for clinical development, left the Executive Board of Eckert & Ziegler AG at the end of December 31, 2023.\n\n### **ACKNOWLEDGMENT**\n\nThe Supervisory Board would like to thank the Executive Board and all employees for their outstanding performance in the financial year 2023.\n\nBerlin, March 2024 For the Supervisory Board\n\nAndreas Eckert\n\n**DR ANDREAS ECKERT** Chairman of the Supervisory Board\n\n*<sup>\\*</sup> Following a comprehensive review, the Executive Board has submitted to the Supervisory Board an amended proposal for the appropriation of net profit compared to the proposal presented in the notes to the annual financial statements. This is the Executive Board's proposal for the appropriation of net profit in the amount of € 0.05 dividend per dividend-bearing share. The Supervisory Board has analyzed this proposal and agreed with this amended resolution proposal, so that reference is made in this report of the Supervisory Board to this amended proposal of the Executive Board for the appropriation of net profit. An announcement regarding this resolution on the appropriation of net profit was published on March 19, 2024.*\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-39-0\"></span>The forecast report contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations regarding the future development of the company. The outlook is based on estimates made by management on the basis of all information available to it at the time this report was finalised. The statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are beyond the control of management. If the assumptions underlying the outlook are not correct or the risks or opportunities described materialise, the actual results and developments, both positive and negative, may deviate significantly from the statements made in the outlook. Eckert & Ziegler assumes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements contained in the management report outside the statutory disclosure requirements.\n\n# **4.3 FUTURE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT IN THE ISOTOPE PRODUCTS SEGMENT**\n\nThe Isotope Products segment is forecasting continued strong revenue in . Medical imaging specialist Tecnonuclear S.A. (Argentina) launched new diagnostic products in and expects them to be launched in selected South American markets in the second half of (subject to regulatory approval). Demand for non-Russian oil and gas continues to drive the exploration activities of energy companies and, as a result, the demand for metrological components. The segment has a very strong competitive position, it continues to develop new products and gain additional customers. With the commissioning of new nuclear power plants, the revenue of calibration and environmental monitoring products in the Analytics business division (USA) continue to rise. The Life Cycle Services division is well positioned to benefit from the decommissioning and refurbishment of ageing nuclear facilities. In addition, the sector in Europe is benefiting from growing pressure from regulatory authorities to dispose of unused radiation sources from medical and industrial users. The segment's two largest application areas – medical and industry – remain strong. Owing to the stable supply chain, the market share was expanded in these two mature markets, and the prospects for are positive. Sales with external customers are expected to amount to around million and EBIT before special items to around million.\n\n# **4.4 FUTURE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT IN THE MEDICAL SEGMENT**\n\nIn the Medical segment, it is becoming apparent that the demand of pharmaceutical companies for radiopharmaceutical products and services is growing unabated. Revenue in this area continues to rise in double-digit amounts. Interest remains high for qualified services in relation to development, the construction of production facilities and contract manufacturing. The announced market approvals of new products are expected to provide momentum for pharmaceutical radiodiagnostics, specifically the radionuclide generator GalliaPharm®. The increasing number of approved radiotherapeutic agents in clinical trials will stimulate demand for therapeutic isotopes. Eckert & Ziegler received GMP manufacturing authorisation for the therapeutic nuclide Lu- at its site in Braunschweig in and expects revenue to continue growing in . In view of the planned start of production of Ac- in the second half of , several supply contracts for this nuclide were concluded with pharmaceutical customers in the past year. The segment is therefore forecasting revenue with external customers of just under million in with EBIT before special items of around million.\n\n### **4.5 FUTURE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT IN THE OTHER SEGMENT**\n\nBecause of the strategic alignment of the Other segment, the Executive Board again expects that no external revenue will be generated in the financial year. The segment is forecasting EBIT before special items from continuing operations of around – million.\n\n### **4.6 FUTURE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT IN THE GROUP**\n\nBuilding on the above, the Executive Board hopes to build on the operating result of the financial year and achieve EBIT before special items from continuing operations of around million in . The associated expectation for revenue is nearly million. The forecast is conditioned on a weighted average exchange rate of USD . per euro and the assumption that Eckert & Ziegler will again not suffer any significant upheavals from the war in Ukraine.\n\n# **4.7 FUTURE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT OF ECKERT & ZIEGLER STRAHLEN- UND MEDIZINTECHNIK AG**\n\nFor , Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG expects to post revenue of around million. The forecast revenue is thus above the level of the previous year. In operational terms, EBIT before special items is expected to total – million. It will be offset by planned income of million from dividends and profit transfers.\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-40-0\"></span>**5. OTHER DISCLOSURES**\n\n# **5.1 EU TAXONOMY**\n\n### **5.1.1 EU taxonomy**\n\nThe aim of the EU taxonomy is promote investment flows from the financial sector to companies that are engaged in ecologically sustainable activities. It is intended to help the European Union implement the European Green Deal. In this regard, the objective is to reduce net emissions from greenhouse gases in the EU to zero by . Against this background, the EU Taxonomy Regulation went into force in mid-, which establishes a unified, legally binding classification system for determining which economic activities in the EU are considered environmentally sustainable. On the basis of the defined requirements, the EU-wide classification of economic activities is made with respect to their contribution to the following six environmental objectives:\n\n- () Climate change mitigation\n- () Climate change adaptation\n- () Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n- () Transition to a circular economy\n- () Pollution prevention and control\n- () Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nWith respect to the classification of an economic activity as \"environmentally sustainable\" within the meaning of the EU taxonomy, a distinction must be made between taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-compliant. As a first step, it must be examined whether an economic activity is described in the delegated act and thus is taxonomy-eligible. Only taxonomyeligible economic activities may be considered \"economically sustainable\" when they meet certain criteria. Then, in a second step, it must be evaluated whether the specified technical screening criteria are met in order to be classified as taxonomy-compliant.\n\nFor the year under review, the only business activities to be considered are those that contribute substantially to the two environmental objectives \"climate change mitigation\" and \"climate change adaptation\". The description of the economic activity in the delegated act establishes which economic activities may as a general rule be taken into consideration.\n\nAs a company that is obliged to submit a non-financial statement, Eckert & Ziegler is required under Article () of the Taxonomy Regulation to disclose information on how and to what extent our activities are linked to economic activities that are categorised as \"environmentally sustainable\" under EU taxonomy legislation. Furthermore, Eckert & Ziegler is obliged to report the indicators defined in the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\n### **5.1.2 Taxonomy-eligible economic activities**\n\nWe have compared our company activities with the activities defined in annexes and of the delegated act of June across all business divisions, including our Isotope Products, Medical and Other segments. None of Eckert & Ziegler's core business activities are classified as taxonomy-eligible. The analysis showed that no revenue-generating activity within the meaning of the EU taxonomy is undertaken at this time. With the economic activities currently covered by the taxonomy, the Technical Expert Group on Sustainable Finance (TEG) has prioritised the sectors that are responsible for . of all direct greenhouse gas emissions in the EU. The taxonomy thus covers the economic sectors of forestry, agriculture, production of goods/manufacturing, energy supply, water supply, sewage and waste disposal and the removal of environmental pollution, transport and storage, information and communication and construction. Eckert & Ziegler's business activities are not among these. Eckert & Ziegler produces only small quantities for its products and is, therefore, generally considered a low emitter of carbon dioxide. Above all, however, all energy-intensive raw materials are produced in a climate-neutral manner, since Eckert & Ziegler procures its output materials mainly from operators of nuclear reactors.\n\n### **5.1.3 Calculation of taxonomy indicators**\n\n### **Revenue**\n\nBy revenue, the EU taxonomy means net revenue from goods or services. The proportion of revenue derived from taxonomy-eligible economic activities (numerator) is then divided by the net revenue shown on the income statement (denominator).\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Capital expenditure**\n\nCapital Expenditure (CapEx) within the meaning of the EU taxonomy covers additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets during the financial year under consideration. This includes additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that result from company mergers. Eckert & Ziegler makes reference to the capital expenditure shown in the notes (denominator). Of this, the proportion of the taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure is to be specified (numerator). Data collection and the detailed analysis are handled by Controlling.\n\n### **Operating expenditure**\n\nOperating expenditure (OpEx) within the meaning of the EU taxonomy covers direct, non-capitalised costs that relate to research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leasing, maintenance and repair. Eckert & Ziegler makes reference to the expenditure for maintenance and repair, renovation, research and development, and costs for short-term leasing (denominator). Of this, the proportion of the taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure is to be specified (numerator). Data collection and the detailed analysis are handled by Controlling.\n\n### **5.1.4 Presentation of taxonomy indicators**\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\n**41**\n\n| Financial year 01/01/- 31/12/2023                                                                                      |         | 2023                              | Criteria for a significant contribution |                           |                           |                                                              |                                  |                                  | DNSH criteria                                             |                           |                           |                                                              |                                  |                                  |                                                           |                    |                                           |                                |  |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--|\n| Economic activities                                                                                                    | Code(s) | Absolute revenue in €             | Share of revenue                        | Climate change mitigation | Climate change adaptation | Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources | Transition to a circular economy | Pollution prevention and control | Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems | Climate change mitigation | Climate change adaptation | Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources | Transition to a circular economy | Pollution prevention and control | Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems | Minimum protection | Taxonomy-compliant share of revenue, 2022 | Category (enabling activities) |  |\n| A.

In order to identify the expected date of demolition, we assessed, among other things, the lease term in accordance with the existing lease agreements and reconciled this with the underlying schedule. We reviewed the scope of the measures and the dismantling obligations as well as the costs assumed by the legal representatives for the valuation. For this purpose, we reconciled the production facilities with the schedule of assets as part of a deliberate selection process and assessed the assumed costs by comparing the estimated costs with the current costs. In addition, we obtained an expert opinion on the measures to be implemented and the expected costs, which we assessed as part of our audit.\n\nIn order to assess the provisions for disposal obligations, we first obtained an understanding of the process of systematically recording and updating the quantities of radioactive waste. We compared these inventories with the inventory of radioactive residues on a sample basis. We gained an understanding of the assumptions and expectations made by the legal representatives in their planning with regard to the disposal routes, the associated costs and the planned disposal dates. In doing so, we examined the planning assumptions for the years following the balance sheet date by scrutinizing and assessing the planning parameters in detail, in particular the planned cost trends and disposal dates.\n\nFurthermore, we assessed the discount rates used by the client and verified the calculation of the present values of the provisions.\n\nOn the basis of our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the estimates and assumptions made by the legal representatives with regard to the measurement of the provisions for restoration obligations and disposal obligations are justified and balanced.\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Other information**\n\nThe legal representatives or the Supervisory Board are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the following non-audited components of the Group management report:\n\n- the corporate governance statement pursuant to Section 289f and Section 315d HGB, to which reference is made in the Group management report,\n- the separate non-financial report pursuant to Section 315b (3) HGB, to which reference is made in the Group management report\n- the remuneration report pursuant to Section 162 AktG, to which reference is made in the Group management report, and\n- the non-management report disclosures in section 5.1 of the Group management report relating to the EU taxonomy;\n\nThe other information also includes:\n\n- the assurances pursuant to Section 297 (2) sentence 4 and Section 315 (1) sentence 5 HGB on the consolidated financial statements and Group management report\n- the report of the Supervisory Board and\n- the remaining parts of the annual report excluding cross-references to external information - with the exception of the audited consolidated financial statements and group management report and our auditor's report.\n\nThe legal representatives and the Supervisory Board are jointly responsible for the remuneration report. The Supervisory Board is responsible for the report of the Supervisory Board. Furthermore, the legal representatives are responsible for the other information.\n\nOur opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information:\n\n- is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n- otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Responsibilities of the executive directors and the supervisory board for the consolidated financial statements and the group management report**\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e (1) HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\n# **Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report**\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\n",

The advantages are obvious. Although we are a German company, we operate primarily on a European and international level. Structural adjustments, cooperations and the expansion of our growing business can be implemented even more efficiently as an \"SE\" than before. Although the change of name is important, I can assure you that our mission statement, \"Contributing to saving lives\", will remain unchanged in the future.\n\nMore important than this change in legal form is the new record that Eckert & Ziegler achieved in the past financial year with sales of almost € 250 million. We are very satisfied with this ongoing positive development, as 2023 was also a challenging year for Eckert & Ziegler in many respects: geopolitical upheaval, high inflation rates, rising interest rates and energy prices, to name just a few adversities. Nevertheless, as an isotope specialist, we performed well across all segments.\n\nToday, we employ over 1,000 people. That's quite a journey! A good ten years ago, we still had 500 employees under contract and achieved a turnover of € 100 million. Since then, both the number of EZAG employees and our turnover have doubled.\n\nThe driving force behind our business continues to be the unbroken high demand for radiopharmaceuticals for nuclear medicine. Last year, we expanded our product range by the isotope lutetium-177, which is important for cancer treatment. This means that we now provide all common nuclides for our customers. The flagship product, the gallium generator, achieved another sales record thanks to continued strong demand. This year, we will launch actinium-225 on the market, once again demonstrating our leading position in the field of isotope production. Part of this positive development is our plant engineering division in Dresden, which is now making a significant contribution to the Medical segment's sales growth.\n\nThe Isotope Products segment's performance also improved in 2023. The backlog of customer orders caused by the pandemic was cleared and made up for. The signs are once again pointing to growth in 2024. The segment recorded continuous growth, particularly in the area of calibration sources for nuclear medicine and isotope supply. Demand for radiation sources for the energy sector also increased in 2023 despite the recessionary pressure; we are expecting this to continue in the current year.\n\nLast but not least, various investment projects around the globe have kept us busy. We are not only expanding our sites in North and South America. In Germany and China, we are also moving full steam ahead after the corona break. Together with our Chinese joint venture partner, we are expanding our core expertise in this important market. Nevertheless, the era of cheap money is over. Even more reason to manage not only investments but also the total capital involved in such a way that the funds tied up remain within reasonable limits.\n\nChanges have also been made to the corporate structure: the founder of Eckert & Ziegler, Dr Andreas Eckert, moved from the Executive Board to the Supervisory Board after more than 30 years and since then has accompanied us with commitment and dedication. Over the past few months, the newly appointed Executive Board has held intensive discussions with both the Supervisory Board and all management levels about the company's future strategy. This also included the decision to focus more\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/4/Picture/0 description: This image shows a man in a suit and tie. The text in the upper left corner reads \"Eckert & Ziegler Annual Report 2023 LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS\". The number 3 is in the upper right corner.\n\nstrongly on core competencies in future: The production and sale of radioisotopes. Adjacent areas such as Pentixapharm or Myelo no longer fit into this spectrum despite their promising prospects and led to the communicated spin-off decision.\n\nThe future looks optimistic. Recent drug developments in the pharmaceutical industry and the increasing number of radiopharmaceutical companies are promising. In recent months, the capital market has finally opened up again – many companies active in the development and marketing of diagnostic and therapeutic drugs have either been able to secure financing or have been acquired entirely by Big Pharma. Both of these developments are positive for us, as they will further increase the demand for radioisotopes in the future. That will benefit us and we are already preparing for this within our investment planning.\n\nOur success is based on the strong commitment of our employees in 13 countries and on our cornerstones such as diversity, inclusion and equal opportunities. The different experiences and perspectives of our employees enrich our corporate culture, promote creativity and innovation and help us to offer our customers needs-based solutions. A working environment in which everyone is given the opportunity to develop and realize their potential without harassment, discrimination or disadvantage is therefore essential for us. We attach great importance to constantly improving in terms of diversity, inclusion and equal opportunities with the help of our employees and managers. Discrimination, racism and extremism have no place at our company. This is a promise to all employees that they will feel represented and valued within the Group. At the same time, it is also an expectation that these standards are respected and practiced by everyone.\n\nFinally, we align our corporate activities sustainably with a balanced relationship between economic, social and ecological aspects and refer to the principles defined in our Code of Conduct. Last year, we stepped up our work both personally and technically to collect global ESG key figures and to implement the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) as required by law.\n\nOn behalf of the company management, I would like to thank all customers, partners and employees, but above all you, our shareholders, for your loyalty and solidarity.

GROUP FUNDAMENTALS**\n\n# **1.1 BUSINESS MODEL OF THE GROUP**\n\nThe Eckert & Ziegler Group (Eckert & Ziegler) is an international manufacturer of isotope technology componentsfor medical, scientific and industrial applications. In addition to Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG, a listed German stock corporation with its registered office in Berlin, the Group comprises additional companies, including minority interests. The Group is managed by the Executive Board, which is supported in its decisions by the advice of the Extended Executive Board, which consists of the Executive Board of Eckert & Ziegler AG and the heads of select business divisions.\n\nThe company's core competencies include the handling and processing of isotope technology materials in specially equipped and approved production facilities in Europe, the United States, Brazil and Argentina. Eckert & Ziegler develops, produces and sells medical devices for cancer therapy as well as radionuclides for nuclear medicine applications and synthesis equipment for the production of radiopharmaceuticals. Plant engineering and the retrieval of isotope technology waste from hospitals and research institutions round out the portfolio.\n\nThere are comparatively few providers in the international markets where Eckert & Ziegler operates. As its competitors serve only specific market niches, Eckert & Ziegler has no direct competitor offering the same range of products. The market is characterised by high barriers to market entry due to licensing requirements as well as rapid technological progress, considerable research expenditure and constant new scientific discoveries. This market is regulated by German federal, state and local authorities. These regulatory authorities include the Regional Office for Health and Social Affairs Berlin (LAGeSo), the Technical Monitoring Agency (TUV Nord CERT GmbH, Essen), the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM), and the corresponding foreign institutions, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). As a result, the Group is directly affected by changes in technology and in products used in cancer treatment and for nuclear medical imaging, by government regulations related to the industry in which Eckert & Ziegler operates, and by the general environment within the health care sector.\n\nThe operating business is managed through subsidiaries in the two operational segments Medical and Isotope Products, which target different customer groups with their various product groups. The Other segment includes the holding company, which pools internal group services such as Radiation Protection, Legal, Accounting, IT and HR, as well as Pentixapharm AG and its subsidiary Myelo Therapeutics GmbH. In October , the Supervisory Board of Eckert & Ziegler AG gave its approval to the Executive Board to prepare a spin-off of up to per cent of the shares in Pentixapharm AG. Pentixapharm AG and its subsidiary Myelo Therapeutics GmbH form the division that comprises the Group's clinical assets. The focus here is on the development of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. This division will be discontinued and the spin-off is being prepared. In accordance with the provisions of IFRS , the noncurrent and current assets and liabilities of Pentixapharm AG and Myelo Therapeutics GmbH are recognised as discontinued operations. In view of the enormous growth forecast for active pharmaceutical ingredients, Eckert & Ziegler intends to pool its financial resources to expand its global manufacturing capacities and concentrate on its core competences in order to further expand its position as a leading supplier of radioisotopes for the production of radiopharmaceuticals.\n\nThe Isotope Products segment manufactures isotope technology components for imaging techniques, scientific applications, quality assurance and industrial measurement purposes. In addition, the segment offers a variety of services: taking back of radiation sources from customers and receiving low-level isotope technology waste, for example, from hospitals and other institutions, processing and conditioning of radioactive waste, recycling of isotope technology materials, transport and logistics, provision of service technicians for inspection, maintenance and commissioning of irradiation facilities, professional disposal of waste and restoration. With the acquisition of the Argentinian company Tecnonuclear S.A., the product range now includes SPECT diagnostics, consisting of technetium- generators and a portfolio of related biomolecules.\n\nThe segment's most important locations are in Valencia and Atlanta (USA), São Paulo (Brazil), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Prague (Czech Republic), and Braunschweig, Dresden and Leipzig (Germany).\n\nIn the Medical segment, the majority of revenue is attributable to pharmaceutical-grade radioactive substances that fulfil diagnostic or therapeutic functions as part of a drug and to drug products. The most important items include the <sup>68</sup>Ge/<sup>68</sup>Ga radionuclide generator GalliaPharm<sup>®</sup>, which enables the radioactive labelling of carrier molecules for the purpose of the sensitive diagnosis of various types of cancers, and the therapeutic isotopes yttrium-, lutetium- and phosphorous-. Yttrium- has a number of uses, such as in the production of radioactive embolizers for the treatment of liver tumours.\n\nWith its own GMP facilities, the Medical segment offers a variety of radiopharmaceutical services under GMP and cGMP conditions, all from a single source. These include complete early-development services, including process development \n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-20-0\"></span>and scale-up, CMC manufacturing and packaging, product approval and stability programmes. As a contract radiopharmaceutical manufacturer, Eckert & Ziegler is capable of providing small batches for phase I, II or III clinical trials as well as large batch sizes for commercial use.\n\nIn addition, the segment markets products designed for radiation therapists, a group of doctors that is specialised in treating cancer through irradiation. The two most important products are small implants for the treatment of prostate cancer based on iodine- (\"seeds\") and eye applicators based on ruthenium- and iodine- for the treatment of uveal melanomas (eye cancer).\n\nFinally, the Medical segment includes a project business directed at international medication developers, which provides them with support in the development and approval of new radiopharmaceuticals, the manufacture of test batches as well as the development of production facilities and the associated infrastructure. The business is grouped around a plant engineering department located in Dresden, whose range of products is supplemented by laboratory equipment, radiosynthesis equipment, quality-control equipment, and consumables, as well as a wide array of services.\n\nThe segments' markets and various products are only loosely connected with each other. Each has its own cycles and distinctive characteristics. There are also national differences in the overall conditions. This is particularly the case with medical products whose intensity and dynamics of demand are influenced by the level of services provided by national healthcare systems and the presence of local competitors.\n\nIn the medium term, the Group is expected to continue to grow sustainably and profitably. The Group intends to achieve this on the one hand through organic growth, based for example on the (continued) development of new and existing products, or by entering into new geographical markets. On the other hand, the Group seeks opportunities for profitable acquisitions and aims to generate revenue by improving efficiency.\n\n# **1.2 BUSINESS MODEL OF ECKERT & ZIEGLER STRAHLEN- UND MEDIZINTECHNIK AG**\n\nEckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG operates as a financial and management holding company and as a strategic development partner for its subsidiaries; it does not conduct its own business operations. The main sources of revenue are therefore service fees, interest and profits distributed by or transferred from the subsidiaries.\n\n# **1.3 MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**\n\nThe Executive Board manages the Group's production and revenue companies. It sets the course for strategic development, makes important decisions with the managing directors, and monitors subsidiaries' achievement of targets.\n\nThe long-term business plan for the Group is drawn up for five financial years and is updated annually on the basis of the previous year's figures. The annual individual business plan is bottom-up and is based on the business plans for each business division prepared by the respective managing directors together with the Executive Board. Detailed targets are formulated with regard to predefined control parameters and key performance indicators for the individual production and revenue companies. These individual business plans take into account estimates regarding the development of the industry.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of each financial year, the Executive Board submits to the Supervisory Board a detailed annual Group business plan for the following financial year. Ongoing monitoring of the budget variables takes place as part of central quarterly reporting.\n\nThe Controlling segment prepares reports for the business divisions and monitors performance in relation to planning, with particular focus on the key performance indicators of revenue and annual net income. The controllers report directly to the Group Executive Committee on a quarterly basis with a structured financial report on quantitative and qualitative developments in the reporting period. From the financial year, \"EBIT before special items from continuing operations\" will be used as a second performance indicator in addition to revenue instead of net income for the year. Focussing on these two parameters provides a better assessment of the operating performance of the core business without special items, i.e. without effects that are special in terms of their nature and amount for the management of the Group. These include financial and currency results, losses in accordance with IAS (hyperinflation), acquisition costs, divestments and restructuring. When calculating this key figure, EBIT from continuing operations is increased by extraordinary expenses and reduced by extraordinary income. As a result, the forecast for the financial year will also be converted to these key performance indicators.\n\nThe financial management of the Group largely takes place at the segment level, with some differences in the implementation.\n\nAt regular meetings, the Executive Board gathers information about the market situation and sets the course in coordination with managing directors and segment heads. A comprehensive review of the annual business plan is carried out once a year.\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-21-0\"></span>**1.4 RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT**\n\nTotal expenditure forresearch and development, including capitalised development costs increased from . million in the previous year to . million in . Most of this is attributable to the companies Pentixapharm AG and Myelo Therapeutics GmbH, which are recognised as discontinued operations. Expenditure on research and development increased from . million in the previous year to . million in , of which . million was capitalised.\n\nThe other development costs totalling . million (previous year: . million) are attributable to the core business. In the Isotope Products segment, they remained at the previous year's level at around . million, while expenses in the Medical segment increased by . million to . million. No development costs were capitalised in these two segments.\n\nIn the financial year, an average of employees worked in the development departments across the Group (previous year: ).\n\nAs in the previous year, the contribution to revenue made by products that have been added to the portfolio in the last years is .\n\nThe interlocking of the development departments of the business divisions creates synergies. This makes it even easier to implement specific customer requests. For customers' proprietary radiodiagnostics and radiopharmaceuticals, Eckert & Ziegler can offer, for example, all developmental steps: from development of the chemical manufacturing process to production of the process module required for this purpose (cassette) to suitable synthesis equipment that can be used to manufacture the medication in the hospital and dispense it to patients.\n\n### **1.4.1 MEDICAL SEGMENT**\n\n### **Radiopharma business division**\n\nEckert & Ziegler has entered into a long-term cooperation with the Nuclear Physics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Ústav jaderné fyziky (UJF), for the production of the alpha emitter actinium- (Ac-). The agreement stipulates that Eckert & Ziegler will provide the UJF research centre with several million euros for investments in equipment and hot cells as well as radium- (Ra-) as a starting material for tests and irradiation. In return, Eckert & Ziegler will receive exclusive access to the production capacities of a pilot plant being built near Prague, as well as coutilisation rights to process steps being developed for large-scale commercial Ac- production.\n\nThe Braunschweig site is therefore investing in production processes to make Ac- available in drug quality for clinical trials and subsequently for commercial applications.\n\nIn view of the planned start of production of Ac- in , several supply contracts for this nuclide were concluded with pharmaceutical customers in the past year.\n\nEckert & Ziegler received GMP manufacturing authorisation for the therapeutic nuclide lutetium- (Lu-) at its site in Braunschweig in and also submitted a Drug Master File (DMF) to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The company succeeded in concluding a strategically important contract with a well-known pharmaceutical company for the supply of this isotope over a period of years.\n\nThe GMP facility built at the Berlin site was technically commissioned and must now be approved by the authorities as a pharmaceutical production facility. It will enable Eckert & Ziegler to offer complete early-development services, including process development and scale-up, CMC development, manufacturing and packaging, product approval and stability programmes. It will also put the company in a position to operate as a contract manufacturer of clinical-standard radiopharmaceutical products for phase I, II and III trials as well as for commercial use.\n\nThe production process for the therapeutic nuclide yttrium- (Y-) was further expanded in Wilmington, MA, USA (Greater Boston area).\n\nEckert & Ziegler is also continuing to invest in the development of a process for the production of ytterbium- (Yb-), an indispensable precursor for the production of Lu- that is only available in very small quantities. This production process, which was partly financed by Eckert & Ziegler and developed by Atom Mines LLC (Texas, USA), is intended to resolve the bottleneck and enable Eckert & Ziegler to offer Lu- in large quantities to pharmaceutical companies all over the world.\n\n### **Laboratory Equipment business division**\n\nUntil now, synthesis devices such as Modular-Lab systems and standardised sterile cassettes for single-dose production have been manufactured for hospitals in particular. In addition to this routine business, new fields of application were opened up for synthesis devices.\n\nFor instance, Eckert & Ziegler now builds customised automation solutions for the nuclide labelling of diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals with adapted hardware and software modules on behalf of pharmaceutical and radiopharmaceutical companies.\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe company is also further developing the Modular-Lab system so that it can be used as a platform for mRNA synthesis and purification of novel, non-radioactive cancer drugs.\n\nIn the reporting period, the transfer of device production for the quality control of radiopharmaceuticals from the USA to the Berlin site was successfully completed and of these devices were manufactured. This corresponds to an increase of around compared to the previous year. The quality control application area for alpha emitters has become increasingly important. The development focus on qualifying the device portfolio for these applications has proven to be the right decision and will be continued. A good market position for these devices, particularly in the USA, will benefit Eckert & Ziegler's business development as a supplier of the promising alpha emitter Ac-.\n\nOrganisational measures were continued in the clean room production area for cassettes in order to meet the requirements of GMP-compliant production of customer-specific cassettes. The company SCINTOMICS Molecular, Applied Theranostics Technologies GmbH has audited and commissioned Eckert & Ziegler Eurotope GmbH as a contract cassette manufacturer. Contract manufacturing for this customer is planned for the long term and is to be expanded by at least one cassette type in .\n\n### **1.4.2 ISOTOPE PRODUCTS SEGMENT**\n\nThe Isotope Products business division continued its close relationships with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the field of medical imaging and expanded its product portfolio of SPECT/CT and PET/CT products. Two types of point sources for Siemens have been developed and launched on the market. One of these is an Se- source and is used at the Siemens plant for quality control in the manufacture of collimators. The second is an Na- source, a modification of an existing source that is compatible with Siemens software. In addition, two Co- line sources for Spectrum Dynamics scanners (D-SECT and VERITON) were modified and released for the needs of the Japanese market. Further OEM sources for PET imaging of the brain are in the final testing and design control phase. In response to customer demand, the design of the phantom shield has been improved and a counterweight hinge has been added, making the device much easier and safer to use. These shields are of particular importance for the mobile PET market, as additional shielding is required, especially during road transport.\n\nDue to the geopolitical tensions in Europe and the Middle East and the resulting risk of disruption to the supply chain, the Isotope Products segment continued to see the need to further diversify its sources of supply for key raw materials. This year, the focus was on radioisotopes, but also included non-radioactive components. Ge- and Co- are essential for the production of PET and SPECT sources for the medical imaging market, which is why additional sources were qualified here in particular. Diversifying the supply chain and reducing the number of sole suppliers for key materials remains a priority.\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-23-0\"></span>**2. BUSINESS REPORT**\n\n# **2.1 BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND NET ASSETS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE GROUP**\n\n### **2.1.1 Business development of the Group**\n\nIn , the Eckert & Ziegler Group set a new record with revenue of . million. Compared to the previous year, revenue increased by . million or . Adjusted for currency effects, revenue increased by . million or .\n\nThe Radiopharmaceuticals business remains the biggest growth driver, with growth of to . million across all segments.\n\nAccording to estimates, this market for nuclear medicine will continue to grow many times over in the coming years. In view of this strong growth forecast for active pharmaceutical ingredients, which is already reflected in revenue, Eckert & Ziegler intends to pool its financial resources to expand its global manufacturing capacities. In October the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of Eckert & Ziegler AG therefore decided to dispose of the Group's clinical assets. The Supervisory Board has given its approval to the Executive Board to examine and prepare a spin-off of up to per cent of the shares in Pentixapharm AG. Eckert & Ziegler is concentrating on its core competences in order to further expand its position as a leading supplier of radioisotopes for the production of radiopharmaceuticals.\n\nEckert & Ziegler brought together numerous renowned experts in Boston in June for the first Boston Radionuclide Theranostics Forum. Potential and existing partners as well as key players in the industry discussed the central topics of the rapidly developing radiotheranostics market. The forum focussed on discussions about solutions to challenges in the areas of supply chains, upscaling, patient access and the latest theranostic concepts.\n\nIn addition to the steadily developing core business, contracts or reservation agreements were concluded with various customers over the course of the year for the supply of the latest radioisotopes in Eckert & Ziegler's portfolio, lutetium and actinium-. One example of this is a contract signed in September with POINT Biopharma Global Inc. for the supply of no carrier added lutetium- (n.c.a. Lu). The agreement has a term of ten years with total revenue volume of more than million.\n\nThe revenue target of million expected in the forecast report for was exceeded.\n\n### **Revenue development with external customers in detail**\n\nAt . million, revenue in the Isotope Products segment was on a par with the previous year (previous year: . million), meaning that the segment remains the Group's largest segment in terms of revenue. In the Medical segment, revenue increased by . million or to . million compared to the previous year.\n\nWith revenue of . million (previous year: . million), the Americas remain the most important revenue region in the financial year. In terms of consolidated revenue, it contributed to revenue (previous year: ). The largest single national market for Eckert & Ziegler products in was once again the United States, where goods worth . million were sold compared to . million in the previous year. Revenue in Europe also rose by . million to . million, with the share of consolidated revenue amounting to (previous year: ). Germany remained the most important European market with . million (previous year: . million).\n\nWhile sales in the Medical segment rose in Europe (), sales in the Isotope Products segment in the region remained just below the previous year's level (–). In the Americas, the Group recorded growth totalling , with growth distributed across the segments as follows: Medical , Isotope Products –. Business in Asia grew by across all segments compared to the previous year, making it the fastest growing region.\n\nSales are mainly invoiced in EUR. Total EUR revenue accounted for (previous year: ), USD revenue (previous year: ) of consolidated revenue.\n\n### **2.1.2 Financial performanceof the Group**\n\nAt . million, the consolidated net income in the reporting period was . million or below the previous year's figure. The share of earnings attributable to shareholders of Eckert & Ziegler AG amounts to . million, which corresponds to . per share. Of the consolidated net profit, a loss of . million (previous year: . million) was attributable to discontinued operations.\n\nThe main growth driver remains the strong business with pharmaceutical radioisotopes, leading to an overall increase in the gross margin of . million to . million. Selling expenses rose by . million or to . million, while general administrative expenses increased by . million, from . million in the previous year to . million. Other operating income fell by . million to . million; in the previous year, income of . million was recognised \n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\nfrom the deconsolidation of Wolf-Medizintechnik GmbH. Other operating expenses increased by . million to . million. Overall, the operating result of . million was on a par with the previous year (previous year: . million).\n\nCompared to the previous year, currency effects had a negative impact on earnings of . million more than in the previous year; the loss according to IAS (hyperinflation) decreased by . million to . million (previous year: . million). Results from the valuation of financial instruments fell by . million to –. million. As a result, EBIT fell by . million to . million.\n\nSignificantly higher interest expenses reduced net interest income by . million compared to the previous year. Earnings before taxes fell by from . million to . million. Income tax expenses fell from . million to . million. Overall, consolidated net income from continuing operations fell by . million to . million in the year under review.\n\nOf the consolidated net income from continuing and discontinued operations, . million (previous year: . million) is attributable to non-controlling interests, so that the share of earnings attributable to the shareholders of Eckert & Ziegler AG fell from . million in the previous year to . million in the year under review.\n\n### **2.1.3 Developmentof the segments**\n\n### **Isotope Products segment**\n\nThe segment's main product groups are:\n\n- () Radiation sources\n- () Tc-m generators and consumables\n- () Trade in raw isotopes and other products\n- () Services\n- () Disposal of low-level isotope technology waste\n\nThe important first product group involves isotope technology components for imaging techniques, scientific applications, quality assurance and industrial measurement purposes. Eckert & Ziegler has long possessed a solid market position with a significant share of world market volume. Radiation sources for medical quality assurance continue to grow.\n\nThe second main group comprises the Argentinian nuclear medicine specialist Tecnonuclear S.A., a manufacturer of technetium- generators and a portfolio of related biomolecules. Together with the generators, these generic tracers are often also referred to as SPECT diagnostics. Sales of Tc-m generators and consumables for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) amount to just under . million in .\n\nThe third main product group makes use of Eckert & Ziegler's purchasing leverage to resell raw isotopes to third parties at a profit.\n\nThe last two main product groups are services such as taking back sources from customers and accepting low-activity isotope technology residues, conditioning radioactive waste, recycling isotope technology material, transport and logistics, arranging service technicians for the inspection, maintenance and commissioning of irradiation facilities, professional disposal of waste and dismantling. Business development may be subject to high fluctuations due to project-related services offered. Revenue from services is mainly based on individual orders and non-recurring repeat orders.\n\nThe Isotope Products segment achieved revenue of . million, an increase of . million () compared to the previous year. While revenue with external customers was slightly below the previous year's level, internal Group revenue grew by . million.\n\nThe gross margin totalled . million (previous year: . million), which corresponds to an increase of . million or compared to . In relation to revenue, the margin developed only marginally and grew from to ; this increase is essentially due to the product mix as well as annual price adjustments and volume effects. Inflation adjustments in the hyperinflationary country of Argentina reduced earnings by . million (previous year: . million).\n\nEBIT in the year under review totalled . million, compared to . million in the previous year. Interest expenses increased by . million compared to the previous year. Tax expenses totalled . million (previous year: . million), which corresponds to a tax rate of .\n\nThe segment generated earnings before minority interests of . million, which corresponds to an increase of . million compared to .\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Medical segment**\n\nThe segment's main product groups are:\n\n- () Longer-lived radioisotopes for pharmaceutical applications\n- () Early-development services for radiopharmaceutical products\n- () Radiosynthesis equipment and supplies\n- () Quality control equipment\n- () Implants for the treatment of prostate cancer \"seeds\"\n- () Therapeutic accessories\n- () Ophthalmological products\n- () Other therapeutic products and plant engineering\n\nIn the Medical segment, revenue, including revenue with other segments, increased by . million or to . million. The rise was driven, in particular, by strong demand for radiopharmaceuticals.\n\nHowever, a disproportionately high increase in the cost of sales had a negative impact on the segment's gross margin, which rose by . million to . million. Continuous growth is spurring the company to make further investments in production infrastructure and human capital. Costs in connection with investments already made in the future, in particular depreciation and amortisation and personnel costs, are already having a negative impact on earnings.\n\nOverall, selling and administrative expenses were . million or higher than in the previous year. At . million, EBIT was around . million below the previous year's result.\n\nIn particular, negative currency effects totalling . million and the deconsolidation of Wolf-Medizintechnik GmbH (earnings contribution of . million in ) had a negative impact on income. In addition, interest expenses increased by . million. Tax expenses totalled . million, which corresponds to a tax rate of .\n\nThe Medical segment achieved a result of . million this year. This corresponds to an increase of . million or .\n\n### **Other segment**\n\nThe holding company Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG finances itself through services provided, such as accounting, personnel administration, IT and radiation protection; each of these is charged on to the subsidiaries plus a profit surcharge. In addition, the holding company makes loans where necessary and earns interest income from them. The holding company also receives income from profit transfers and distributions from the subsidiaries.\n\nIn addition to the holding company, the Other segment also includes the discontinued operations of the Group's clinical assets. These include Pentixapharm AG and Myelo Therapeutics GmbH.\n\nOverall, earnings before non-controlling interests fell by . million to –. million in the year under review compared to the previous year, of which . million (previous year: . million) was attributable to discontinued operations.\n\nThe founder and Chairman of the Executive Board Dr Andreas Eckert and the Chief Operating Officer of the Medical segment, Dr Lutz Helmke, stepped down from their positions at the Annual General Meeting at the beginning of June . Dr Harald Hasselmann took over the duties of both as well as the chairmanship of the Executive Board. Franklin Yeager, the long-standing head of the Isotope Products segment, who is based in California, was newly appointed to the Executive Board and is responsible for the Isotope Products segment.\n\nIn connection with the planned spin-off of Pentixapharm AG, there was a further change to the Executive Board of Eckert & Ziegler AG at the end of the year. The Executive Board member responsible for clinical development, Dr Hakim Bouterfa, left the Executive Board of Eckert & Ziegler AG at the end of the year.\n\n### **2.1.4 Financial positionof the Group**\n\nThe result for the period before minority interests for the continuing operations is . million below the previous year's result at . million.\n\nDespite the slight decrease in the result for the period, the cash flow from operating activities increased by . million to . million and almost corresponds to the result for increased by depreciation and amortisation.\n\nThe cash outflow from investing activities of continuing operations totalled . million (previous year: . million). Investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets increased from . million in the previous year to . million. . million was spent at Qi Kang Medical Technology in Jintan, China, which was deconsolidated as at December . . million was spent on acquisitions in the year under review (payment to the former shareholders of Tecnonuclear SA, Argentina), compared to . million in the previous year (acquisition of the shares in Tecnonuclear SA and Myelo Therapeutics GmbH). This was offset by cash inflows from the sale of shares in consolidated companies totalling . million (previous year: . million) and income from investments amounting to . million \n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\n(previous year: . million). In the previous year, cash inflows from the sale of securities totalling . million and cash outflows for the acquisition of shares in companies consolidated at equity amounting to . million (Atom Mines LLC, USA) were recorded.\n\nThe cash outflow from financing activities of continuing operations increased by . million to .million (previous year: . million) compared to the previous year. The taking out of loans resulted in a cash inflow of . million (previous year: . million). This contrasted with higher cash outflows of . million for the repayment of loans and lease liabilities (previous year: . million). The Annual General Meeting held in June resolved to issue a dividend of . (previous year: .) per share. The cash outflow for the dividend payment to the shareholders of Eckert & Ziegler AG and distributions for third-party interest therefore amounted to . million in the year under review (previous year: . million).\n\nIn addition, the relatively stronger euro (particularly in relation to the USD) led to a currency-related increase in cash and cash equivalents by . million (previous year: . million increase). Cash and cash equivalents as at December amounted to . million. Compared to the end of , this corresponds to a decrease of . million, of which . million resulted from the reclassification to discontinued operations.\n\n### **2.1.5 Net assetsof the Group**\n\nDue to the order-related offsetting of open orders valued \"at percentage of completion\" (POC) with the advance payments received, which was recognised for the first time in under the items \"Contract assets\" and \"Contract liabilities\", there was a slight balance sheet contraction. The balance sheet was adjusted accordingly.\n\nAs at December , all assets and liabilities of Pentixapharm AG and its subsidiary, Myelo Therapeutics GmbH, are reported as assets and liabilities classified as held for sale. In October , the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of Eckert & Ziegler AG decided to dispose of the Group's clinical assets. At the end of the financial year, assets totalling . million and liabilities totalling . million were allocated to the discontinued operation. The balance sheet items for will not be adjusted in accordance with IFRS regulations.\n\nThe balance sheet total as at December increased by . million and compared to the adjusted annual financial statements and now amounts to . million (previous year: . million).\n\nOn the assets side, goodwill fell by . million to . million. The decrease is mainly due to adjustments as part of the final PPA for Myelo Therapeutics GmbH. Other intangible assets decreased by . million. This decline is almost entirely due to the reclassification of the other intangible assets of Pentixapharm AG and Myelo Therapeutics GmbH to assets held for sale.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment fell by . million to . million. This was mainly due to exchange rate effects on the property, plant and equipment of the foreign subsidiaries reporting in USD and ARS. . million in asset disposals from the deconsolidation of Qi Kang Medical Technology was offset by additions to property, plant and equipment in a similar amount. The right-of-use assets in accordance with IFRS increased by . million to . million, primarily from the extension of the lease agreement for the Eckert & Ziegler AG Group headquarters building in Berlin-Buch. Shares in associated companies or joint ventures increased by . million to . million. The increase is mainly due to the addition of the joint venture formed with the Chinese pharmaceutical company DongCheng Pharma (DC Pharma) in November . DC Pharma acquired a . million stake in the EZAG subsidiary Qi Kang Medical Technology Co., Ltd. (QKM) by way of a capital increase and will hold of the shares. Accordingly, QKM, which was previously fully consolidated, has been recognised in the consolidated balance sheet under investments in associates or joint ventures since this date. Deferred tax assets increased by . million to . million. In total, non-current assets decreased by . million to . million.\n\nCurrent assets increased by . million to . million (previous year: . million). This is due in particular to the change in the presentation of previously non-current assets of Pentixapharm AG and Myelo Therapeutics GmbH under assets held for sale. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by . million compared to the end of and totalled . million. . million of the decrease is attributable to cash and cash equivalents of Pentixapharm AG and Myelo, which are reported under assets held for sale as at December (refer to the \"Liquidity\" section for details). Trade receivables increased by . million in line with the increase in revenue, while contract assets rose by . million. Inventories increased by . million to . million. At . million, other assets were roughly on a par with the previous year, while income tax receivables increased by . million to . million (previous year: . million).\n\nOn the liabilities side, non-current liabilities fell by . million to . million. Non-current bank loans decreased by . million to . million, with . million in new bank loans and . million reclassified to current liabilities, as these amounts are due for repayment in . Lease liabilities (IFRS ) increased by . million to . million. Deferred tax liabilities decreased by . million to . million and the other non-current liabilities increased by . million to . million. The decrease in both items is mainly due to the reclassifications made in connection with the planned spin-off/disposal of Pentixapharm AG. The sharp increase in other non-current provisions of . million to . million is mainly due to higher provisions for dismantling and disposal obligations. Provisions for pensions also increased, rising by . million to . million.\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-27-0\"></span>Current liabilities increased by . million to . million, with the majority of the increase again being attributable to reclassifications to liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale. These reclassifications are also the main cause of the changes in the items: trade payables (decrease of . million), income tax liabilities (increase of . million) and other current liabilities (decrease of . million). Other current provisions increased by . million to . million mainly due to higher provisions for short-term disposal obligations.\n\nTotal equity increased by . million to . million. Retained earnings increased by . million. The addition from the annual result of . million was correspondingly reduced by the distribution of the dividend in the amount of . million. Other reserves, which also include unrealised actuarial gains or losses in addition to translation differences on the equity of subsidiaries reporting in foreign currencies, reduced by . million, from . million to –. million. The capital reserves increased by . million to . million. The \"treasury shares\" item fell from . million to . million. The increase in the capital reserve and the decrease in treasury shares is due to the utilisation of , treasury shares in connection with share-based payments to employees and the sale of , treasury shares to Pentixapharm AG.\n\nThe equity ratio as at December was (previous year: ).\n\n# **2.2 NET ASSETS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF ECKERT & ZIEGLER STRAHLEN- UND MEDIZINTECHNIK AG – NOTES BASED ON THE GER-MAN COMMERCIAL CODE (HGB)**\n\n### **Business development of the company**\n\nIn the financial year, there was a control and profit and loss transfer agreement between Eckert & Ziegler AG as the controlling company and the affiliated company Pentixapharm AG (formerly Pentixapharm GmbH) as the controlled entity. A profit and loss transfer agreement was also in place between Eckert & Ziegler AG and Eckert & Ziegler Radiopharma GmbH, as well as between the latter and its subsidiary. The annual profit or loss generated by the other subsidiaries is not completely transferred to the parent company, meaning that the separate financial statements of Eckert & Ziegler AG differ substantially from consolidated net income.\n\n#### **Financial performance of the company**\n\nCompared to the previous year, the main changes to the income statement were as follows:\n\n- () Sales increased by . million to . million. This primarily relates to income from services and rents for affiliated companies. The year-on-year increase was due to more extensive services and charges.\n- () Other operating income increased by . million to . million. The increase is mainly due to higher income from the reversal of provisions.\n- () At . million, personnel expenses increased by . million compared to the previous year's figure of . million. This is partly due to the increase in the number of employees compared to and the expansion of the Executive Board. The company's remuneration system for members of governing bodies is set out in the remuneration report.\n- () Depreciation and amortisation on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets amounted to . million, which was at a level similar to the financial year.\n- () For its financial assets, Eckert & Ziegler AG calculated the enterprise value in each case using the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, which is based on current planning calculations over a five-year period. The company values determined as at December for all shares in affiliated companies were higher than the investment values recognised in the balance sheet. In the financial year, the company valuation for the investment in Eckert & Ziegler BEBIG GmbH resulted in a lower value than the carrying amount of the investment recognised up to that point. An impairment loss of . million was therefore recognised for this investment in the previous year.\n- () Other operating expenses increased by . million to . million compared to the previous year. The increase is mainly due to higher legal and consulting costs as well as services procured from third parties, which rose by a total of . million compared to .\n- () In the financial year, Eckert & Ziegler AG took over a profit of . million (previous year: . million) from its German subsidiary Eckert & Ziegler Radiopharma GmbH as part of the profit and loss transfer agreement. Eckert & Ziegler AG took over a loss of . million in the financial year (previous year: . million) from the profit and loss transfer agreement with Pentixapharm.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\n- () Eckert & Ziegler AG received a profit distribution from its subsidiaries Eckert & Ziegler Isotope Products Holdings GmbH totalling . million. This amounted to . million in the previous year. Eckert & Ziegler AG received a further . million (previous year: . million) in profit distributions in the financial year from a minority interest in a company.\n- () At –. million, total interest and similar expenses and other interest and similar income were –. million below the previous year's level of –. million.\n- () The sale of all shares in Myelo Therapeutics GmbH to the wholly owned subsidiary Pentixapharm AG in September generated income of . million for Eckert & Ziegler AG. Eckert & Ziegler AG realised income of . million from the sale of , shares in Pentixapharm AG (. of the share capital). There was no such income in the previous year.\n- () Despite the increase in earnings before taxes, income tax expenses fell by . million year-on-year to . million. The decline is mainly due to the fact that earnings before taxes in the financial year included . million income that was not recognised in the previous year.\n\nIn total for the financial year, an annual surplus of . million (previous year: . million) is reported, which is . million higher resulting from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries.\n\n### **Net assets and financial position of the company**\n\nThe balance sheet total of Eckert & Ziegler AG increased by . million to . million compared to the previous year. On the assets side, the increase in the balance sheet total is mainly reflected in the additions to shares in affiliated companies and receivables from affiliated companies. On the liabilities side, equity increased by . million and liabilities to affiliated companies by . million.\n\nThe following significant changes occurred in the financial year:\n\nInterests in affiliated companies rose sharply by . million, from . million to . million. In the financial year, . million was invested in capital reserve increases at the subsidiary Eckert & Ziegler Radiopharma GmbH and . million in capital increases at Pentixapharm AG, which used these funds for the acquisition of Myelo Therapeutics GmbH, among other things. This was offset by capital repayments of . million received from the subsidiary Eckert & Ziegler BEBIG GmbH, the sale of . of the shares in Pentixapharm AG totalling . million and the sale of Myelo Therapeutics GmbH to Pentixapharm AG amounting to . million.\n\nReceivables from affiliated companies increased by . million from . million in the previous year to . million. This was mainly due to the receivable resulting from the profit and loss transfer agreement with Eckert & Ziegler Radiopharma GmbH.\n\nBank balances amounted to . million as at December compared to . million as at December .\n\nEquity totalled . million, an increase of . million compared to the previous year. The increase is due to the net profit of . million generated in the financial year and . million from the use of treasury shares for employee remuneration. This was offset by an outflow of . million for the dividend distributed in the financial year.\n\nProvisions decreased by . million to . million. The reduction in provisions is mainly due to a . million decrease in tax provisions compared to the previous year.\n\nThe . million increase in liabilitiesfrom . million in the previous year to the current figure of . million is mainly due to the increase in liabilities to affiliated companies. On the one hand, liabilities to Pentixapharm AG from the assumption of losses under the profit and loss transfer agreement increased by . million; on the other hand, a credit line granted by Eckert & Ziegler Nuclitec GmbH in the amount of . million was utilised as at December .\n\nAs at December , the company had committed cash credit lines from banks in the amount of . million which were not utilised.\n\nOverall, the Executive Board continues to rate the company's economic position as very good. The equity ratio is (previous year: ).\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-29-0\"></span>**2.3 EMPLOYEES**\n\nAs at December , Eckert & Ziegler had a total of , employees across the Group (previous year: ). The number of employees thus increased by persons year-on-year. The increase is mainly attributable to the Medical and Other segments. In the Medical segment, the expansion of the workforce is a necessary step to meet the growing demand for radiopharmaceutical products. The majority of the increase in the Other segment is attributable to the ongoing expansion in the clinical development area. The discontinued operations accounted for a total of employees as at December (previous year: ).\n\nIf employee figures are calculated based on the definition set forth in the German Commercial Code (HGB), which relates to the average number of employees over the course of a year and excludes members of the Executive Board and managing directors, as well as trainees and interns, but includes part-time employees and employees with minimal working hours, the number of employees rose from to .\n\nEckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG had an average of employees, or more employees than in the previous year.\n\nAt , the turnover rate, defined as the number of employees who left the company during the year under review, was slightly above the previous year's level of , which is in line with the general trend and shows a slight increase in turnover to pre-crisis levels. However, this is still well below the average turnover rate in Germany, which was . in . The percentage of women in the total workforce stood at (previous year: ). At years of age, the average age in the financial year was on a par with the previous year, with a focus on the to age group. Slightly fewer than half of all employees have a degree from a university of applied sciences/bachelor's degree or a higher level of education.\n\nPersonnel expenses from continuing and discontinued operations totalled . million in the reporting period (previous year: . million). This translates into average personnel expenses of around . thousand per employee in , compared to around . thousand in the previous year.\n\nImage /page/29/Figure/7 description: The image contains two bar charts. The first bar chart is titled \"AVERAGE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES BY SEGMENT\". The x-axis shows the segment, and the y-axis shows the average number of employees.

In South America, the number of employees is 168 in 2022 and 180 in 2023. In Others, the number of employees is 8 in 2022 and 8 in 2023.\n\n# **2.4 OVERALL STATEMENT CONCERNING THE ECONOMIC POSITION**\n\nThe financial year was very successful. Eckert & Ziegler was able to increase revenue to a record level of over million. The demand for radiopharmaceutical products was again the largest growth driver across all segments. In addition, the Isotope Products segment was able to further strengthen its market position as a result of rising energy costs. Adjusted for one-off effects, earnings in the core business also continued to grow compared to the previous year. Overall, Eckert & Ziegler AG generated income of . per share from continuing operations. If discontinued operations are included, income is reduced to . per share.\n\nThe strong market positions of the respective segments are reflected in a solid balance sheet. The solid balance sheet ratios, such as the equity ratio, return on equity, debt repayment period and similar performance indicators, continue to provide the Group with financial latitude. The planned spin-off of Pentixapharm AG is intended to help the Eckert & Ziegler Group to pool its financial resources for the expansion of global manufacturing capacities in order to continue to meet the enormous growth forecast for active pharmaceutical ingredients. Eckert & Ziegler is concentrating on its core competences in order to further expand its position as a leading supplier of radioisotopes for the production of radiopharmaceuticals.\n\nOverall, the Executive Board is satisfied with the development of the operating business and the result achieved in .\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-31-0\"></span>**3. REPORT ON OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS**\n\nEckert & Ziegler AG's shareholders need to be aware that the Group as a whole is exposed to a wide range of opportunities and risks that may influence the company's business activities and share price. This report outlines the risks and opportunities and their potential impact on the Group as a whole. Furthermore, it describes the Group's risk management system and the safeguards it has put in place.\n\nThe group's opportunities and risks indirectly affect the parent company, Eckert & Ziegler AG, through its participations in other entities.\n\n### **3.1 ORGANISATION OF RISK MANAGEMENT**\n\nThe task of risk management is to systematically identify opportunities and risks and to assess them with respect to the effects they may have on the company. The term \"risk\" is therefore defined as variation from an expected value. According to this definition, both positive deviations (opportunities) and negative deviations (risks) are considered.\n\nThe overall responsibility for risk management lies with the Executive Board. However, operational responsibility – i.e., the early recognition, evaluation, management, and documentation of risks; the specification and implementation of suitable countermeasures; and the corresponding communication – lies primarily with the respective segment management and the management of the subsidiaries. This level below the Executive Board bears responsibility for risk management in its area. In addition to the annual structured risk assessment process, operational management is obliged to constantly monitor its area with regard to a changing risk situation. Fundamental changes to the specific risk situation for the area must be reported immediately to segment management and the Executive Board. Changes to risks with fundamental financial implications must also be reported to Group accounting.\n\nEckert & Ziegler's technical and managerial staff are consulted as part of the aforementioned annual process concerning structured risk analysis. They are asked to designate new and existing opportunities and risks and classify them according to the probability of occurrence and their potential impact on the company. Preventive measures are taken, contingency plans are drafted if applicable, and regular evaluations are organised for these risks to the extent possible.\n\nThese include monitoring the market and competitors, evaluating scientific literature, analysing customer complaints, and statistics on costs and revenue, among other things. The assessment of risks according to probability of occurrence and the potential extent of losses is reported to the Supervisory Board once a year.\n\nAs part of risk management, risks are classified into risks from the use of financial instruments, political risks, legal risks, IT risks, personnel risks, procurement risks, general risks arising from the production and handling of radioactivity, revenue market risks and strategic risks, risks from cost increases due to price hikes, main customer risks and research and development risks. The risk owners are identified. In a risk matrix, the identified risks are presented in terms of their likelihood of occurrence and their potential financial impact on the Group's net assets, financial position and financial performance in the categories very unlikely/unlikely/fairly unlikely/not very likely/fairly likely and very low/low/ medium/high/very high. Risks which jeopardise the company as a going concern are – where present – highlighted and reported separately. Risks are classified as follows:\n\n| Classification | Intensity             |\n|----------------|-----------------------|\n| 0 – Very low   | < 1 million euros     |\n| 1 – Low        | 1 to 2 million euros  |\n| 2 – Medium     | 2 to 5 million euros  |\n| 3 – High       | 5 to 20 million euros |\n| 4 – Very high  | > € 20 million        |\n\n| Classification      | Probability of occurrence within 24 months |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| 0 – Very unlikely   | < 0.01%                                    |\n| 1 – Unlikely        | 0.01% to < 0.5%                            |\n| 2 – Fairly unlikely | 0.5% to < 2%                               |\n| 3 – Not very likely | 2% to < 10%                                |\n| 4 – Fairly likely   | 10% to < 50%                               |\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-32-0\"></span>Overall, a risk-minimising approach is chosen. Existing risks are consistently monitored and are minimised or safeguarded against through ongoing process improvements. New product developments and acquisitions are checked for potential risks from the very start and are incorporated into the risk management system. Market developments are monitored, as are the activities of competitors, with the aim of being able to swiftly and promptly modify and implement the Group's own strategies.\n\nThe Supervisory Board – which is informed about and approves all key decisions, and which is regularly kept up to date on business developments – serves as an additional risk-protection element.\n\n# **3.2 FINANCIAL RISKS**\n\nThe avoidance of financial risks is monitored and managed by tools such as annual financial planning with adjustments during the year and careful analysis of deviations from the plan. This makes it possible to identify potential risks at an early stage and take appropriate countermeasures. In addition, derivative financial instruments are used to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates associated with operational business. Since hedges are entered into only for transactions whose volume exceeds certain thresholds, exchange rate fluctuations and changes in interest rates continue to have a certain impact on the Group's results.\n\n### **Liquidity risk**\n\nProbability of occurrence: **fairly unlikely**/intensity: **very high**\n\nThe Group believes that it currently has sufficient financial resources to ensure its continued existence as a going concern. Eckert & Ziegler's cash and cash equivalents totalled . million as at the reporting date. Net liquidity at the end of the year totalled €41.6 million<sup>1</sup>. The Group thus believes that it is in a position to meet all of its financial obligations.\n\nThe primary requirement for the ability to be able to refinance on favourable terms where necessary is the Group's good credit rating. This is confirmed by the credit terms offered. The Executive Board believes this is because of the Group's solid financing with a high equity ratio and the favourable prospects of the operating units. In addition to the high equity ratio, solid balance sheet ratios further underpin the Group's creditworthiness, as non-current assets are more than covered by equity and non-current liabilities.\n\n### **Risks from contingent liabilities**\n\nProbability of occurrence: **fairly unlikely**/intensity: **medium**\n\nGuarantees and sureties were provided for the benefit of subsidiaries. As at December , Eckert & Ziegler AG had committed guarantee lines in the amount of . million, of which . million had been drawn down for guarantees. However, no claims under the guarantees are expected.\n\n### **Exchange rate risks**\n\nProbability of occurrence: **fairly likely**/intensity: **medium**\n\nBecause it operates globally, the Group is exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates. Since the subsidiaries in the US, Brazil and Argentina generate the majority of the Group's revenue, the Group is positively or negative affected by changes in exchange rates in connection with the foreign currency translation (US dollar, Brazilian real and Argentine peso) of positions in the income statement. Through its global production network, the Group is in a position to offset most of the revenue generated in foreign currency against costs that are likewise incurred in foreign currency. Where required, the Group uses forward transactions and simple put options to hedge foreign currency revenue generated by German exports.\n\n### **Default risks for customer receivables**\n\nProbability of occurrence: **unlikely** (previous year: fairly unlikely)/intensity: **very low**\n\nThe Group is exposed to default risk on its trade receivables, in particular, in connection with its numerous foreign transactions.\n\nRisk exposure is primarily influenced by the size of the customers and the country-specific rules and opportunities for settling reimbursements of medical services by public providers.\n\nNew customers are assigned a credit score and first deliveries generally require advance payment. Deliveries to customers that are considered a permanent risk due to their size or location are secured by advance payment, sureties or letters of credit. Thus, high receivables are secured with documentary transactions.\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-33-0\"></span>The risk is monitored by means of regular past due analyses of all trade receivables. A functioning dunning management system has been established.\n\n### **Interest rate risk**\n\nProbability of occurrence: **not very likely**/intensity: **low**\n\nEckert & Ziegler has loan liabilities of . million as at December . Some of these are fixed-rate loans for which there is no interest rate risk. Others have to do with variable interest rate financing (-month Euribor) in connection with an interest rate cap.\n\nCommitted cash credit lines totalling . million are generally subject to interest rate risk. However, these were not utilised as at December .\n\nIn connection with testing the impairment of the carrying amounts of the participations in subsidiaries (impairment test), an increase in interest rates can result in a decline in fair values. If they fall below the carrying amount of the goodwill or the carrying amount of the interests in subsidiaries, this would create the need for a write-down at the consolidated level or in the separate financial statements of Eckert & Ziegler. This would have a negative impact on the net assets and financial performance of the Group or Eckert & Ziegler AG as a standalone company.\n\n### **3.3 POLITICAL RISKS**\n\n### **War in Ukraine**\n\nProbability of occurrence:**fairly likely**/intensity: **medium**\n\nThe military attack by Russia on Ukraine continues to adversely impact the global economy and the performance of companies. Eckert & Ziegler is primarily exposed on the procurement side. Sales to Russia are of minor significance in the Group. Economic sanctions are currently focused on exports to Russia and on the country's ability to access capital markets. As an importer, Eckert & Ziegler is not directly affected. Based on the sanctions, administrative procedures have been adjusted, and alternative transport routes have been established. So far, we have not been faced with insurmountable obstacles and continue to receive deliveries from Russia. Alternative suppliers outside of Russia are available for a number of radioisotopes.\n\n#### **Geopolitical tensions**\n\nProbability of occurrence: **not very likely**/intensity: **high**\n\nPersistent political tensions between other countries likewise harbour the latent risk of conflicts, with effects for the global economy and ensuing embargoes and supply difficulties. As a globally operating group, Eckert & Ziegler would be exposed to risk on the revenue side as well as the procurement side.\n\n### **3.4 LEGAL RISKS**\n\nProbability of occurrence:**fairly unlikely/intensity**: **medium**\n\nThe Group is exposed to legal risks arising from legal disputes or governmental or official proceedings in which it is currently involved or that may arise in the future. At this time, legal disputes or lawsuits that are not or not fully covered by insurance or provisions and that could have a significant adverse impact on consolidated net income are neither pending nor discernible, with the exception of the situation described below.\n\nA lawsuit is pending by individuals against the German state of Lower Saxony seeking a withdrawal of the company's licence to handle radioactive materials at the Braunschweig location, and the subsidiary concerned is involved in the proceedings as a joined party. If a final and binding judgement is entered ordering withdrawal of the licence, this would affect a substantial portion of the services provided at the Braunschweig location. Outsourcing to other locations would be partially but not fully possible.\n\nIn-court and out-of-court legal disputes are handled by in-house attorneys, who engage outside lawyers where necessary.\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-34-0\"></span>**3.5 IT RISKS**\n\nProbability of occurrence:**fairly likely**/intensity: **medium**\n\nEckert & Ziegler is exposed to the risk of IT system outages. In the event of loss/damage, this could result in loss of data and, in the worst-case scenario, business interruptions. There is also the risk of active hacking, phishing and malware. Protective measures include regular backups, antivirus software, firewalls, anti-malware software and the widespread use of virtualised servers.\n\n# **3.6 PERSONNEL RISKS**\n\nProbability of occurrence: **fairly likely**/intensity: **medium**\n\nIn many business divisions, Eckert & Ziegler depends on the specialised knowledge of its employees. The company depends on the knowledge and expertise of particularly highly qualified key individuals, especially when developing new business fields as well as in development and distribution. In order to minimise the risk of losing talented employees, the company strives to create a pleasant and supportive atmosphere, a modern and secure working environment, adequate remuneration, professional training and further education opportunities, and flexible working hours. Eckert & Ziegler is reliant on employees with specialist knowledge. In some cases, vacant positions cannot be filled immediately due to the lack of qualified personnel. Despite employee-friendly measures, Eckert & Ziegler cannot guarantee that these employees will remain with the company or display the necessary level of commitment.\n\n# **3.7 PROCUREMENT RISKS**\n\nProbability of occurrence: **not very likely**/intensity: **very high**\n\nThe risk of delivery bottlenecks and production downtime arises if it is not possible to source all raw materials and indirect materials at the required time and in the necessary quantities. The Group could lose key suppliers, suppliers could experience capacity bottlenecks, or political and organisational changes in the \"supplier\" countries could delay deliveries or make deliveries impossible. This risk can never be fully excluded. It can, however, be counteracted through warehousing and by establishing alternative sources of supply.\n\n### **3.8 GENERAL RISKS FROM THE PRODUCTION AND HANDLING OF RADIOACTIVITY**\n\nProbability of occurrence: **not very likely**/intensity: **high**\n\nBoth radioactivity itself and its use in medical or medicinal products involve product liability risks. Eckert & Ziegler addresses these risks by adhering to strict quality criteria. The majority of sites are ISO-certified, and the functioning of the quality management systems is regularly checked by internal and external audits. In order to avoid accidents that could injure employees, cause damage to the environment, or prompt regulatory agencies to close down production facilities, employees regularly undergo training on occupational safety and radiation protection. Despite all these measures, it cannot be ruled out that events giving rise to liability could nevertheless occur and pose a threat to the company. As far as it is possible and feasible, appropriate insurance has been taken out to guard against liability risks.\n\nEckert & Ziegler is dependent on specialised service providers to ship products worldwide that are often transported as hazardous goods. It cannot be guaranteed that these offers will be maintained in the existing form. Special official authorisation is necessary for the manufacturing and shipment of many products. Eckert & Ziegler is able to exert only indirect influence on the issuance or renewal of such authorisation. Given the rising threat of terror around the world, there is also the risk that the transportation of radioactive components will be more strictly regulated.\n\nThose who handle radioactive materials require a licence. This licence is issued by the competent authority in the relevant German federal state. The licence for handling radioactive materials is issued under Section of the German Radiation Protection Ordinance (StrlSchV). The licence is subject to compliance with extensive conditions listed in Section StrlSchV, and there is a risk that these will not be complied with. The application for a licence or amendment to a licence must be accompanied by appropriate documents to document compliance with the aforementioned requirements. The licence can be withdrawn if certain regulations, in particular, documentation regulations, are not complied with.\n\nEckert & Ziegler makes every effort to comply with all the relevant regulations and to implement any changes, orders and documentation requirements in a timely manner. Other authorisations, which are also mandatory for the business, are complied with and the relevant regulations and measures are introduced on time. While Eckert & Ziegler works closely with the approval authorities and also uses the help of local partners in regulatory matters, there is a risk that it may not be possible to implement certain requirements within the specified time limit. Eckert & Ziegler relies on options for the disposal of isotope technology waste, which is created when taking back sources or during production. A closure \n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-35-0\"></span>or delayed opening of disposal facilities can lead to significant increases in costs. Efforts are made to reduce the impact of this risk to the greatest extent possible through internal recycling. However, this uncertainty cannot be completely eliminated.\n\nThere is also the risk that already classified radioactive waste may have to be disposed of differently than initially assumed due to new official regulations. This may result in the actual costs exceeding the values stated in the provision.\n\nThe handling of radioactive substances requires approval from the relevant government authorities. It cannot be ruled out that production or handling in individual cases or at certain locations may become more expensive, restricted or even prevented due to changes in legal or regulatory conditions.\n\n# **3.9 MARKET RISKS AND STRATEGIC RISKS**\n\nProbability of occurrence: **not very likely**/intensity: **medium**\n\nAs a specialist for a broad portfolio of isotope technology components, irradiation units, and radiopharmaceuticals, Eckert & Ziegler is better protected against slumps in the market than single-product companies. Although the various business segments are technologically close, they differ considerably in the product lifecycle as well as in the customer and market structures. This diversification generally reduces the risk that competitors will undermine the company's business foundation with new and better products. Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that improved processes and efforts by competitors might cause the loss of important markets, thereby jeopardising the company.\n\nTo counter this threat, Eckert & Ziegler actively seeks to develop new products and to identify and develop new business fields. However, there is the risk that such efforts will remain unsuccessful and that new business fields will be developed too late, inadequately, or not at all. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that competitors might have greater success with other products or market launch strategies.\n\nIn the medical divisions, the economic success of Eckert & Ziegler's products depends on cost reimbursement for the respective applications. A reduction or elimination of cost reimbursement would have dire consequences for revenue and earnings. Capital goods are also sold in the segments. In this regard, there is a risk of public and private customers being limited by budgetary constraints.\n\nStrategic risks relate to projects like geographic expansions or strategic participations. In addition to great opportunities, these projects also harbour risks. Failure to achieve the objectives associated with each of the projects could have an impact on the financial performance of the Group, but not directly on liquidity.\n\n# **3.10 RISKS POSED BY COST INCREASES DUE TO PRICE HIKES**\n\n### **Risk posed by cost increases in material procurement**\n\nProbability of occurrence: **fairly likely**/intensity: **low**\n\nThere is a general risk that suppliers will increase their list prices by – annually – or even more in times of high inflation – and this could have an adverse impact primarily on the gross profit margin. Price negotiations and strategic purchasing decisions (such as framework agreements, quantity discounts, etc.) can counteract these developments or improve predictability and provide cost certainty for a certain period of time.\n\n### **Risk posed by cost increases in the remediation of radioactive waste sites**\n\nProbability of occurrence: **fairly likely**/intensity: **medium**\n\nThere is a much higher risk from cost increases in the case of the current stockpiles of radioactive waste. As a result of political decisions and changes in legal requirements as well as government capacities, the costs of disposal may rise, for example, due to a reclassification of radioactive waste, bottlenecks in acceptance and thus time delays or higher acceptance costs as a result of changes to permanent disposal site conditions, which are passed on to the disposing companies. Therefore, the provisions created and calculated on the basis of the knowledge and assumptions available today may not be sufficient to cover the actual disposal costs. For this reason, the management of the companies concerned places the highest priority on the processing and timely disposal of these stockpiles of radioactive waste. Increased costs as a result of inflation, cost structure modifications and price increases expected in the future were sufficiently taken into account as at December in the calculation of the provision for the disposal of radioactive waste and for the decontamination of buildings and facilities, meaning that as things stand today, Eckert & Ziegler does not expect further, substantial unplanned cost increases.\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-36-0\"></span>**3.11 MAIN CUSTOMER RISK**\n\n### Probability of occurrence:**fairly unlikely**/intensity: **low**\n\nThere is a risk that main customers will reduce their purchase volumes individually or collectively. The lower demand from one of the main customers would have an adverse impact on the Group's financial performance. The Group's ten largest customers account for of operating revenue. This revenue performance is expected to be repeated in , as Eckert & Ziegler attaches importance to long-term arrangements or contracts.\n\n# **3.12 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RISKS**\n\nProbability of occurrence: **not very likely**/intensity: **very high**\n\nThe Eckert & Ziegler Group carries out its own research projects where possible. In this respect, Eckert & Ziegler focuses both on clinical development and on the enhancement of its own existing products. The aim is to strengthen its relative position in relation to competitors and alternative application methods. These measures may remain unsuccessful due to faster market developments or due to the wrong target orientation or even the non-achievement of development targets and subsequently lead to amortisation of intangible assets. Although this impact would be very high, it would not affect liquidity. An attempt is made to minimise the risks through market monitoring and project management-related measures.\n\n# **3.13 RISK DEVELOPMENT**\n\nFor the recognisable risks of the Eckert & Ziegler Group that could have a negative impact on the Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations, we have taken countermeasures and/or, if there is a corresponding probability of occurrence, balance sheet provisions as far as reasonable and possible.\n\nFollowing extensive analysis of the entire risk situation, no risks are currently discernible that could jeopardise the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, nor are any such risks foreseeable at this time, including in connection with other risks.\n\nThere were no major changes to risks compared with the previous year. The military attack by Russia on Ukraine continues to pose a challenge. Eckert & Ziegler has adjusted administrative procedures and established alternative transport routes. So far, we have not been faced with insurmountable obstacles and continue to receive deliveries from Russia. Based on the experiences in , we expect that we will remain able to procure raw materials and supply customers.\n\n# **3.14 OPPORTUNITY REPORT**\n\nThe momentum in M&A activity in recent years reflects the market's interest in decades of developments in radiopharmaceuticals. Precision oncology procedures enable patients to have more targeted tumour treatments, and they deliver higher success rates. Eckert & Ziegler is well equipped to take further advantage of this opportunity due to its established strong position in this niche market. Eckert & Ziegler remains one of the few suppliers of key precision oncology products such as Ge-/Ga- generators, yttrium- and lutetium-. Market growth remains unabated and will also continue in the coming years.\n\nSustainable growth is premised on the ongoing review and optimisation of existing processes and the product portfolio. The company is consolidating its competitive advantages by expanding its approvals and markets. The greatest challenge for the Group remains the identification of and expansion into new business areas aimed at strengthening both new and existing portfolios.\n\nTo this end, the Group is investing heavily in additional laboratories and production facilities for radioisotopes around the world. The acquisition of companies and/or participations also serves the purpose of opening up new business areas for the Group or making production processes more cost-efficient. An example of this is the joint venture agreement concluded in the financial year with Atom Mines LLC (Texas, USA). Eckert & Ziegler has co-financed the development of a new process for the production of ytterbium-, which is indispensable for the production of lutetium- , and will thus be exclusively able to use this high-purity ytterbium- for the production of lutetium- n.c.a. in pharmaceutical quality. Successfully completed development projects give rise to opportunities for disproportionate organic growth. Eckert & Ziegler also sees enormous opportunity in the emergence of new proprietary SPECT tracers. Demand for SPECT tracers is expected to increase dynamically and almost double over the next five years.\n\nOther successful development projects could lead to non-organic growth through new products in the portfolio and thus new business areas. Both would have a positive effect on market share and competitiveness and lead to a considerable increase in income. In this regard, one focus is on the development and manufacture of radionuclides that emit alpha \n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-37-0\"></span>radiation (e.g. actinium-). In connection with this, Eckert & Ziegler and the Nuclear Physics Institute at the Czech Academy of Sciences, Ústav jaderné fyziky (UJF), agreed on a long-term collaboration for the manufacture of the alpha emitter actinium-. The agreement calls for Eckert & Ziegler to provide the UJF research centre with several million euros for investments in facilities and hot cells, as well as with radium- as starting material for testing and irradiation. In return, Eckert & Ziegler will receive exclusive access to the production capacities of a pilot plant under construction near Prague, as well as co-utilisation rights to process steps that are being developed for large-scale commercial Ac production. Experts anticipate that demand for actinium- in will increase exponentially in the next decade.\n\nIn addition, the boom in the radiopharmaceutical industry is also creating opportunities in the area of restoration and containment of contaminated sites. While they tend to be classified as a risk due to the growing red tape, this is not necessarily the case. If the management finds innovative solutions that can be used to reduce provisions, this could translate into considerable income. This assessment also applies to provisions for the dismantling of existing plants.\n\n# **3.15 ACCOUNTING-RELATED RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM**\n\nThe primary objective of the accounting-related internal control system is to reduce the risk of material misstatements in accounting, uncover materially inaccurate valuations and ensure that the laws and standards applicable to financial reporting are complied with.\n\nEckert & Ziegler AG prepares its annual financial statements in accordance with the accounting standards under commercial law, taking into account the supplementary provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS rules.\n\nAn accounting-related internal control system was implemented which corresponds to the size of the Group. The following presents organisational arrangements and measures of the accounting-related internal control system:\n\n- All units of the Group are integrated in a defined management and reporting structure. The applicable principles, structural and procedural organisation and defined processes are documented and are constantly adjusted to meet current developments.\n- The consolidated financial statements are prepared according to a schedule which is set centrally by the Group accounting department. The schedule defines all important activities and deadlines.\n- The Group accounting system is organised centrally. The involvement of external service providers in the closing process is generally limited to tax calculations for subsidiaries abroad. In a few exceptional cases, financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared externally.\n- The subsidiaries coordinate with the Group's headquarters on the accounting treatment of new matters. Changes to Group accounting are communicated directly to all employees and external service providers concerned.\n- The reporting of the subsidiaries is conducted using standardised forms which are completed by the respective accounting departments for the monthly, quarterly and annual financial statements.\n- The accounting information of all subsidiaries flows to the segments' controlling department, where it is monitored. Deviation analyses are carried out and discrepancies in terms of compliance with financial statement-relevant Group guidelines are examined and discussed with the respective subsidiary; if necessary, they are reported to the Group accounting department.\n- Initial internal reconciliation and consolidation is carried out at segment level in the central controlling department. This includes, among other things, a reconciliation of receivables and liabilities among the Group companies.\n- Monitoring in the area of consolidation arises from the consolidation process. Reconciliation discrepancies in consolidation are communicated to the respective subsidiaries and rectified.\n- The internal tax department is involved in calculating items relevant for the financial statements that include taxes.\n- Flat hierarchies, direct reporting channels and monthly interim financial statements make it possible to recognise and correct material accounting misstatements in accounting and significant misjudgements in good time.\n\nIrrespective of the specific design, it is not possible to achieve absolute certainty with respect to the meeting of the objectives of the accounting-related internal control system.\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-38-0\"></span>**4. FORECAST REPORT**\n\n# **4.1 COMPARISON WITH THE PREVIOUS YEAR**\n\nIn March , revenue of just under million was forecast for the financial year and a consolidated profit of around million. This forecast relates to the consolidated profit from \"continuing\" operations and operations now recognised as \"discontinued\". These targets were exceeded with revenue of . million and a consolidated profit of . million or . per share.\n\nAs the holding company, Eckert & Ziegler AG has forecast revenue of just over million and an operating loss before interest and taxes (EBIT) of just under million for . Due to dividend and profit transfer income of million and the offsetting takeover of anticipated losses of Pentixapharm AG in the amount of million, the forecast profit after taxes for the financial year should amount to around million. These budgeted figures were exceeded with revenue of million, an operating loss before interest and taxes (EBIT) of million, dividend and profit transfer income of million, income from the sale of shares totalling million and a net profit for the year of million.\n\nThe Isotope Products segment forecast revenue with external customers of around million and a net profit of just under million for . Both target figures were exceeded with revenue of . million and a net profit for the year of . million.\n\nThe Medical segment achieved revenue with external customers of . million, also exceeding the revenue forecast for of just under million. At . million, the planned net profit for the year of around million was narrowly missed due to unplanned financial expenses totalling . million (of which . million from currency losses).\n\nThe holding company and the discontinued operations of the clinical assets, consisting of Pentixapharm AG and its subsidiary Myelo Therapeutics GmbH, form the Other segment. A net loss for the year of around million was forecast for this segment. With a deficit of . million, the planned figure was slightly exceeded, due in particular to unplanned expenses in connection with the ongoing change of legal form to a European stock corporation (SE) and preparations for the spin-off of the clinical assets (. million).\n\n# **4.2 SITUATION AT THE BEGINNING OF 2024 AND FORECAST FOR THE YEAR**\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) is optimistic about the development of the global economy and, in its economic forecast for published at the end of January, assumes that economic growth in will be on a par with the previous year at .. Although global growth remains below the historical average compared to previous decades, the economies of several industrialised and emerging countries have proven to be significantly more resilient than initially assumed. The overall picture is likely to be better for many countries in than in the previous year. The IMF expects economic performance to develop positively in all countries analysed except Argentina. Inflation is falling faster than expected in most regions, as the problems on the supply side and the restrictive monetary policy have been overcome. Overall global inflation is expected to fall to . in . However, the challenge for policymakers remains successfully managing the final reduction in inflation to the target level.\n\nThe war in Ukraine and other global political tensions continue to pose risks. Eckert & Ziegler is primarily exposed on the procurement side. In the past financial year, Eckert & Ziegler has succeeded in importing Russian precursors without any major disruptions. The procurement from Russia of radioisotopes that are needed for production is functioning, as are transport and payment transactions. Alternative sources of supply have now been found for a large proportion of the raw materials required.\n\nTherefore, the following assessment is of course subject to the proviso that Eckert & Ziegler will not experience any further upheavals from the war in Ukraine or inflation. As important contributions to earnings and liquidity are generated by the Isotope Products segment, which is based in the USA, it also assumes that the weighted average exchange rate will be USD . per euro. At the time that the consolidated financial statements were prepared, the exchange rate stood at about USD ..\n\nFrom the financial year, \"EBIT before special items from continuing operations\" will be used as a key figure for the forecast instead of net profit for the year. Sales revenue is forecast to remain unchanged. Focussing on these two parameters provides a better assessment of the operating performance of the core business without special items, i.e. without effects that are special in terms of their nature and amount for the management of the Group. These include financial and currency results, losses in accordance with IAS (hyperinflation), acquisition costs, divestments and restructuring. When calculating this key figure, EBIT from continuing operations is increased by extraordinary expenses and reduced by extraordinary income.\n\n{44}------------------------------------------------\n\n**43**\n\n{45}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-45-0\"></span>**5.2 NON-FINANCIAL REPORTING**\n\nEckert & Ziegler is committed to sustainably aligning its corporate activities with a balanced relationship between economic, social and environmental aspects.

Section AktG governs the appointment and dismissal of members of the Executive Board. The Supervisory Board appoints the members of the Executive Board for a term of office of not more than five years. Repeat appointments or extensions of the term of office for a maximum of another five years are permissible. Such repeat appointments or extensions require another resolution by the Supervisory Board; this cannot be adopted earlier than one year prior to the expiry of the current term of office. The Supervisory Board can appoint a member of the Executive Board to the position of Chairman of the Executive Board. The Supervisory Board can revoke an appointment to the Executive Board and the appointment of a member of the Executive Board as Chairman of the Executive Board for good cause. Possible causes include serious breach of duty, the inability to properly manage business and a vote of no confidence by the Annual General Meeting.\n\nIn accordance with Article of the Company's Articles of Association, the Executive Board consists of one or more members.

The new shares were generally to \n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\nbe offered to the shareholders for subscription; they could also be taken over by one or more banks or one or more equivalent institutions with the obligation to offer them to the shareholders for subscription.\n\nThe Executive Board could, with the approval of the Supervisory Board:\n\n- exclude shareholders' subscription rights up to an amount not exceeding of the share capital existing at the time of the exercise of this authorisation, in order to issue the new shares in exchange for cash contributions at an issue price that is not significantly lower than the market price of the company's shares of the same class that are already listed. Treasury shares of the company that were sold during the period of this authorisation under exclusion of shareholders' subscription rights in direct or analogous application of Section () sentence of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) were counted towards this limit. Furthermore, when calculating the limit, shares issued or to be issued during the period of this authorisation to service convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants were taken into account provided that the bonds were issued under exclusion of subscription rights in analogous application of Section () sentence AktG;\n- exclude shareholders' subscription rights for the purpose of acquiring contributions in kind, in particular, through the acquisition of companies or participations in companies or through the acquisition of other assets, including rights and claims, if the acquisition is in the company's best interest and should be completed in exchange for the issue of shares in company;\n- exclude shareholders' subscription rights to the extent necessary to grant holders of convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants issued by the company or its subsidiaries a subscription right to new shares to the extent to which they are entitled after exercising their conversion or option rights;\n- exclude shareholders' subscription rights to offer the new shares to employees of the company or its affiliated undertakings in return for cash contributions;\n- exclude shareholders' subscription rights to compensate for fractional amounts.\n\nIn addition, the Executive Board is authorised, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to specify further details pertaining to the capital increase and its implementation, particularly the substance of the rights attached to the shares and the other terms of the issue, including the issue price. The Supervisory Board is authorised to amend the Articles of Association after the capital increase is completed and, if the company does not issue shares up to the full amount of the Authorised Capital by May , after the end of the authorisation period.\n\nBy resolution of the Annual General Meeting on June , the Executive Board is authorised until June to acquire treasury shares up to a total of of the share capital existing at the time of the resolution or – if this is lower – when the authorisation is exercised. The shares acquired on the basis of this authorisation, together with other treasury shares held by the company or attributable to it pursuant to Sections d and e AktG, may not at any time account for more than of the respective share capital. The authorisation may be exercised in whole or in part, on one or more occasions, in pursuit of one or more purposes by the company or the Group companies, or by third parties on their behalf. The authorisation may not be used for the purpose of trading in treasury shares. At the discretion of the Executive Board, the shares may be acquired via the stock exchange or by means of a public purchase offer addressed to all shareholders or by means of a public invitation to submit such an offer.\n\n- If the shares are acquired via the stock exchange, the purchase price per share paid by the company (excluding ancillary acquisition costs) may not exceed the average closing price of the company's shares on the Exchange Electronic Trading (Xetra) electronic trading system (or a corresponding successor system) on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange by more than or fall below it by more than on the five trading days preceding the acquisition.\n- If the purchase is made on the basis of a public purchase offer or a public invitation to submit such an offer, the purchase price offered and paid for a share (excluding ancillary purchase costs) may be up to above or below the highest closing price of the company's share in the electronic trading system Exchange Electronic Trading (Xetra) (or a corresponding successor system) on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on the third trading day prior to the publication of the purchase offer. The acquisition offer or the public request to make such an offer may provide for other conditions. The acquisition offer may be modified if the trading price diverges significantly from the offered acquisition price or from the boundary values of any offered price range following publication of the acquisition offer or the public request to make such an offer. In such case, the cut-off date is the day on which the decision by Executive Board to adjust the offer or the request to make such an offer is published. In the case of a public acquisition offer, the company will make an offer to all shareholders in accordance with their shareholding ratio. The volume of the public acquisition offer may be limited. If the total subscription to the offer exceeds this volume, or in the case of a request to make such an offer, multiple offers are not all accepted, the acquisition takes place – under partial exclusion of any right to tender – in proportion to the tendered shares (tender ratios) instead of in proportion to the holding of the tendering shareholders (shareholding ratio). Similarly, in order to avoid fractional amounts, provision may be made for commercial rounding and preferred consideration of small quantities of up to shares for the purpose of acquiring tendered shares of the company per shareholder, under partial exclusion of any right of the shareholders to tender.\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\n- <span id=\"page-47-0\"></span>• The Executive Board is authorised to use shares of the company acquired on the basis of this authorisation for all purposes permitted by law. In particular, the Executive Board may sell them through the stock exchange or an offer made to all shareholders.

They may also be redeemed in a simplified procedure without a capital reduction by adjusting the proportionate arithmetical amount of the remaining no-par-value shares in the company's share capital. The cancellation may be limited to part of the acquired shares. The authorisation to redeem shares may be exercised multiple times. If the redemption is carried out using the simplified procedure, the Executive Board is authorised to amend the number of no-par-value shares in the Articles of Association.\n- The shares may also be sold in other ways than through the stock exchange or by an offer to all shareholders if the shares are sold for cash at a price that is not significantly below the arithmetic mean of the XETRA closing prices of the company's shares on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on the last five trading days preceding the sale. In this case, the number of shares to be sold that were issued in corresponding application of Section () sentence AktG (excluding subscription rights in exchange for cash contributions close to the market price) may not exceed of the share capital, either at the time the resolution is passed or at the time the authorisation is exercised. Shares issued or sold in direct or analogous application of Section () sentence AktG during the term of this authorisation up to this point in time are to be counted towards this limit. Shares issued during the term of this authorisation from authorised capital with the exclusion of subscription rights in accordance with Section () sentence AktG are also to be included.\n- The shares may be issued against contributions in kind, including in connection with the acquisition of companies, parts of companies or company participations and mergers of companies as well as the acquisition of other assets for the purpose of expanding business activities.\n- The shares may be issued to employees of the company and its affiliated companies and to members of the management of affiliated companies and used to service rights to acquire or obligations to acquire shares in the company granted to employees of the company and its affiliated companies and members of the management of affiliated companies, in particular in connection with share-based remuneration or participation programmes and share programmes.

A subsidiary is a company that is controlled by Eckert & Ziegler AG: Control exists if Eckert & Ziegler is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.\n\n**Recognition** – The balance sheet is classified according to maturity. Assets and liabilities are recognised as current if they are due within one year or within one operating cycle or are held primarily for trading purposes. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are classified as non-current if they remain in the Group for longer than one year or longer than one operating cycle. Trade receivables and payables, contract assets and liabilities and inventories are generally recognised as current items. Deferred tax assets and -liabilities are recognised as non-current.\n\n**Measurement** – The consolidated financial statements are based on the principle of historical cost, with the exception of financial instruments, such as certain financial instruments, which are recognised at their fair value on the reporting date.\n\n**Estimation uncertainties** – When preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, it is necessary to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount and presentation of recognised assets and liabilities and income and expenses. Significant assumptions and estimates are made for the useful lives (see Note , Note ), the recoverable amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (see Note ), the realisability of receivables (see Note ), the recognition and measurement of provisions (see Note ) and of financial instruments (see Note ), contract assets and liabilities (see Note ), the determination of the borrowing rate for leases (see Note ) as well as the realisability of deferred tax assets (see Note ). Estimation uncertainties also exist because of the restrictions introduced by Russia in July concerning the foreign repatriation of income from participations in Russian companies, as well as the increased risk of capital loss in the case of associates in Russia, the at-equity interests in associates domiciled in Russia were written down by . In addition, the assumptions and estimation uncertainties in the revenue recognised according to the stage of completion over a period of time for customer-specific production orders are in the range of the planned costs of the individual projects. The premises underlying these assumptions and estimates are based on the knowledge currently available at the given time. Actual amounts may differ from the originally expected estimates because conditions might develop differently than assumed. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in estimates are recognised prospectively.\n\n### **Discretionary decisions in applying accounting policies**\n\n- Non-current intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are recognised in the balance sheet at amortised cost. No use was made of the option to measure these assets at fair value.\n- Investments in which the Group has a significant influence despite holding less than , e.g. due to exclusive longterm supply contracts, are included in the Group as associates.\n\n**Goodwill** – Goodwill represents the difference between the total purchase price for a company or business operation and the fair value of the acquired net assets. Goodwill is not amortised. In accordance with IAS , it is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there is indication that the goodwill might be impaired, and where this is the case, it is written down to the recoverable amount. Impairment losses relating to goodwill are not reversed.\n\nOther **intangible assets** – Customer relationships, capitalised development costs, patents, technologies, restraints on competition, software, licences and similar rights are presented under other intangible assets.\n\n**Development costs** are capitalised as intangible assets if the requirements for capitalisation of internally generated intangible assets in accordance with IAS are cumulatively met, i.e. specifically if all of the following criteria are met:\n\n- Technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset\n- Intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it\n- Ability to use or sell the intangible asset\n- Existence of a market for or an internal use of the intangible asset\n- Availability of technical and financial resources to complete the development\n- Ability to reliably measure the expenditure attributable to the development\n\nCapitalised development costs consist of all directly attributable costs, which are incurred from the date when all capitalisation criteria have been met. After successful completion of the development project, capitalised development costs are amortised over the planned economic life of the product, and the amortisation of capitalised development costs is presented under cost of sales. According to IAS ., intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortised on a regular basis, but are subject to an annual impairment test in accordance with IAS .\n\n{58}------------------------------------------------\n\nResearch costs, along with development costs not eligible for capitalisation, are expensed as incurred.\n\nIntangible assets are capitalised at cost and, provided that these are intangible assets with finite useful lives, are amortised over their respective useful lives. Intangible assets are amortised over the following estimated useful lives:\n\n|                                    | Internally generated | Acquired against payment |\n|------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|\n| Customer relationships             | ─                    | 8 to 15 years            |\n| Capitalised development costs      | 3 to 10 years        | ─                        |\n| Patents, permits, trademarks, etc. | 6 to 20 years        | 10 years                 |\n| Other                              | 3 to 5 years         | 3 to 5 years             |\n\n**Property, plant and equipment** – Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of internally manufactured equipment and facilities includes all direct costs and allocated production overheads, as well as financing costs insofar as the requirements according to IAS are met. Administrative costs are capitalised only if there is a direct connection to manufacturing. Routine maintenance and repair costs are recognised immediately as an expense. Costs for the replacement of components or for overhauls of property, plant and equipment are capitalised if it is likely that the Group will derive the future economic benefit and the costs can be reliably calculated. Where depreciable property, plant and equipment consist of key identifiable components with different useful lives, such components are depreciated separately over the respective useful life (IAS components approach). If available, cost includes the estimated costs for the dismantling and removing the asset and restoring the site on which it is located. Internally manufactured facilities mainly relate to production lines. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis. The depreciation period is determined based on the estimated useful life. The following useful lives are assumed:\n\n| Buildings                      | 25 to 45 years     |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Leasehold improvements         | 10 to 15 years     |\n| Plant and machinery            | 4 to 10 years      |\n| Operating and office equipment | 3 to 13 years      |\n| Land                           | is not depreciated |\n\nWhen assets are scrapped or sold, the cost of the assets and the related accumulated depreciation and impairment losses are derecognised and any gains or losses from the disposal are recognised in profit and loss.\n\nA significant portion of the Group's depreciable assets is used to manufacture products. The Executive Board assesses the impairment of these assets by taking into account triggering events in the business environment. The Executive Board assumed that there was no impairment of usability as at December . However, the Executive Board's assessments regarding the ability to use and exploit the Group's depreciable assets may change, even in the short term, due to technological developments or changes in the regulatory environment.\n\n**Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment** – Impairment losses are recognised on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment if, due to certain events or changed circumstances, the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the recoverable amount of these assets. The recoverable amount is the fair value less costs to sell or value in use, whichever is higher. Acquired goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment at least once a year.\n\nAssets are written up if their recoverable value exceeds their book value. The asset is written up to at most the amount that would have existed if the previous impairment losses had not been recognised. Impaired goodwill is not written up.\n\nTo carry out the impairment test, the acquired goodwill is allocated to those *cash generating units* (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the company and business acquisitions. A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows from continued use and is largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or other groups of assets. In the Isotope Products segment, the CGU corresponds to the segment as a whole, whereas in the Medical segment, four CGUs have been identified.\n\nThe Executive Board considers amounts that exceed of the Group's total goodwill to be material. This criterion is met by the CGU of the Isotope Products segment and by the Medical Devices business unit CGU of the Medical segment.\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment by calculating the value in use based on estimated future cash flows, which are derived from the medium-term projections for the individual segments. The medium-term planning horizon is five years. Cash flows beyond the detailed planning period are forecast by extrapolating the projections using a growth rate, which does not exceed the expected average market or industry growth.\n\nThe discount rates are calculated using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the respective CGU. There is uncertainty with respect to estimates used in the following assumptions used in the calculation:\n\n• Medium-term planning: Medium-term planning is based on past experience and takes into account market growth expectations specific to the business segment.\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Discount rates: The capitalisation interest rates were determined on the basis of the weighted average cost of capital customary in the industry.\n- Growth rates: The growth rates are based on published industry-related market research.\n\n**Inventories** – Inventories include raw materials and consumables, work in progress and finished goods and merchandise. Inventories are recognised at historical cost or net disposal value as at the reporting date, whichever is lower. In addition to direct costs, historical cost includes appropriate portions of the necessary material and production overheads as well as production-related depreciation and production-related administrative and social costs. Financing costs are not recognised as part of historical cost due to the short-term nature of the production process. Where necessary, the average cost method is applied in order to simplify the measurement.\n\nImpairment losses for obsolete or excess inventories are recognised based on an inventory analysis and future revenue forecasts.\n\n**Trade receivables** – A trade receivable is recognised when there is an unconditional right to consideration from the customer. After initial recognition, trade receivables are measured at amortised cost less impairment.\n\n**Cash and cash equivalents** – Cash and cash equivalents include bank balances, cash in hand and short-term deposits with remaining terms of three months or less from the date of acquisition, such as overnight money.\n\n**Pension provisions** – Pension obligations are measured on the basis of the *projected unit credit method* in accordance with IAS (Employee Benefits). Under the projected unit credit method, future salary and pension trends are taken into account in measuring the obligation. In order to standardise Group procedures, actuarial gains and losses have been recognised in other comprehensive income with no impact on profit or loss in consideration of deferred taxes and presented in full in the pension provisions since January .\n\n**Provisions** – Provisions are recognised only when a present obligation arises from past events. Provisions are recognised when it is more likely than not that an obligation has been incurred and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. The amounts recognised as provisions represent the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation as at the reporting date. Provisions with a maturity of more than months are discounted.\n\n**Provisions for restoration and disposal obligations** – Under IAS , the costs of dismantling and removing an item and restoring the site on which it is located are part of cost insofar as provisions for these costs have to be recognised in accordance with IAS .\n\nProvisions for restoration obligations are based on public-law and contractual obligations to decontaminate assets and buildings contaminated with radioactivity, to determine by measurement that they are free from contamination and to make them accessible and usable again without danger once the assets are removed from service. Accordingly, the cost estimate includes labour costs for dismantling the facilities, costs for processing waste to allow for it to be disposed, room cleaning costs, costs for inspections by experts and the costs for disposal of radioactive waste. Provisions with a maturity of more than months are discounted using an interest rate before taxes that reflects the risks pertaining to the debt. The accrued interest on the provision is recognised under interest expense.\n\nUnder IAS , provisions for restoration obligations are calculated in the amount needed to settle them. Provisions are recognised at the present value of the expenditures expected as at the reporting date. The calculation of the restoration obligations is based on various assumptions that reflect estimates. These include estimates of when the project will start, the number of working days required, daily rates and expected material costs. The amount of the provision allows for expected cost increases until the restoration work needs to be carried out. The amount of the obligation is reviewed as at each reporting date. In the event of changes to the amount, property, plant and equipment and provisions are adjusted accordingly.\n\nIn addition, radioactive waste arising from ongoing production and radioactive waste collected by third parties is included and measured at the expected cost of disposal or processing. Provisions are recognised at the present value of the expenditures expected as at the reporting date. The calculation of the disposal obligations is based on various assumptions that reflect estimates. This includes estimates of the reduction schedule, the number of working days required, daily rates and expected material costs. The amount of the provision allows for expected cost increases until the restoration work needs to be carried out. The amount of the obligation is reviewed as at each reporting date. These expenses are recognised under cost of sales.\n\n**Leasing** – A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The right to control the use of an identified asset is conveyed in many contracts, irrespective of their form, e.g. in rental, lease, and service contracts but also as part of outsourcing agreements. As a lessee, the Group recognises leases in accordance with the so-called right-of-use model (IFRS .), irrespective of the economic (ownership) relationships concerning the leased object upon lease commencement. Lessees can elect not to apply the right-of-use model to intangible assets, other than those already explicitly excluded from the scope of IFRS .\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\nSignificant other options and practical expedients were exercised as follows:\n\n- Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are presented separately in the balance sheet.\n- In accordance with IFRS ., the Group elected to account for lease payments as an expense on a systematic basis for low-value leases (< ,) and short-term leases with a lease term of twelve months or less.\n- Where a contract provides for payments for lease components and non-lease components, the Group has elected, except for real estate leases, not to separate non-lease components from lease components in accordance with IFRS ..\n\nOn initial recognition, the lease liability is recognised at the present value of the future lease payments; subsequent measurement is at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Extension or cancellation options are taken into account when determining the term, provided these are exercised with sufficient certainty.\n\nLease liabilities include the following lease payments over the term of the lease:\n\n- Fixed payments\n- Extension and cancellation options of the lessee, provided it is reasonably certain that these options will be exercised in the future\n- Variable payments, if these depend on an index or interest rate\n- Expected residual value payments under residual value guarantees\n- The exercise price of a purchase option\n- Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if an option to terminate is exercised\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at historical cost, which comprises the following:\n\n- Lease liability\n- Initial direct costs\n- Restoration obligations\n\nRights of use are amortised on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their useful life and the expected term of the lease. Rights of use are recognised as part of the impairment test for property, plant and equipment carried out in accordance with IAS .\n\n**Financial instruments –** In accordance with IAS ., all contracts that give rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity are financial instruments.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are classified and recognised as follows in accordance with IFRS (see Note ):\n\n• **Financial assets** – Financial assets are classified into the measurement categories \"at amortised cost\" (AC), \"at fair value through other comprehensive income\" (FVTOCI) and \"at fair value through profit or loss\" (FVTPL).\n\nThe \"at amortised cost\" category includes all financial assets whose business model is linked to the objective of collecting the contractually agreed cash flows (\"hold\" business model). The contractual terms of the financial asset must also be structured in such a way that cash flows representing solely interest and amortisation occur at fixed points in time. In the Eckert & Ziegler Group, this includes in particular cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. The Group assesses the objectives of the business model in which the financial asset is held at the level of the overall company, how the company is managed and the information provided to management. Financial instruments classified at amortised cost are measured at fair value plus transaction costs at the time of acquisition using the effective interest method. Subsequent measurement is also based on the effective interest method, taking into account impairments and repayments. Interest income (using the effective interest method), foreign currency gains and losses and impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nMeasurement at fair value through other comprehensive income is to be applied to financial assets that have the objective of realising cash flows both by collecting the contractual payments and by selling them (\"hold and sell\" business model). The securities were part of the Eckert & Ziegler Group until they were sold in their entirety in .\n\nAll financial assets that are not classified as at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, i.e. financial assets classified as FVTPL, are measured at fair value through profit or loss at the time of acquisition and subsequently. The Eckert & Ziegler Group has financial assets categorised as \"at fair value through profit or loss\" in the form of freestanding derivatives (interest rate cap). In the case of financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs must be recognised directly in the income statement.\n\n{61}------------------------------------------------\n\n• **Financial liabilities –** Financial liabilities are classified in the categories \"at amortised cost\" (AC) and \"at fair value through profit or loss\" (FVTPL).\n\nFinancial liabilities in the \"at amortised cost\" category are mainly liabilities to banks and trade payables.\n\nThe Group measures financial liabilities at amortised cost. Additions are measured at fair value, which is amortised using the effective interest method or disposals made. All financial liabilities that are not categorised as AC are classified as at fair value through profit or loss and measured at fair value through profit or loss at the time of acquisition and in subsequent measurement.\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities were not reclassified after initial recognition. A regular way purchase or sale of financial assets is recognised or derecognised either on the trade date or the settlement date. The Group applies the trade date accounting method. The Eckert & Ziegler Group derecognises a financial asset when its contractual rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset expire, when it transfers its rights to receive contractual cash flows in a transaction or when substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the financial asset are transferred. The Eckert & Ziegler Group derecognises a financial liability when the contractual obligations are fulfilled, cancelled or expire. Financial assets and liabilities are only offset and their net amount recognised in the consolidated balance sheet if there is a legal right to do so and the intention is to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n**Measurement of financial assets and liabilities** – Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorised into the following levels of the fair value hierarchy accordance with IFRS :\n\n- **Level :** The fair value is determined on the basis of quoted, unadjusted prices on active markets for these assets and liabilities.\n- **Level :** The fair value of these assets and liabilities is determined based on parameters for which quoted prices, derived either directly or indirectly, are available on an active market.\n- **Level :** The fair value of these assets and liabilities is determined based on parameters for which no observable market data is available.\n\nSecurities (equity instruments of listed companies) belong to level of the measurement hierarchy.\n\nThe fair values of cash and cash equivalents, current receivables, trade payables, other current trade payables and other receivables essentially correspond to their carrying amounts. The primary reason for this is the short maturity of such instruments.\n\nDerivative financial instruments such as swaps or caps are used only for hedging purposes. They belong to level of the measurement hierarchy and are measured at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet, with changes in value recognised in profit or loss. Due to the high documentation requirements, the regulations on hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS are not utilised.\n\n**Revenue recognition** – Under IFRS , revenue is recognised when the control of goods or services is transferred to the customer. This means that the customer has the ability to direct the use of the transferred goods or services and obtain substantially all the remaining benefits. Revenue is recognised when there is an enforceable right to receive payment from the customer. Revenue corresponds to the contractually agreed transaction price.\n\nIf the agreed transaction price includes variable components, the \"expected value\" or a \"most likely amount\" method is used to calculate the amount of consideration.\n\nThe period between the transfer of goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer is one year or less. For this reason, no financing component is included in the transaction price. Where the contract has multiple identifiable performance obligations, the transaction price will be divided between the individual performance obligations based on the individual selling prices. As a rule, goods and services are sold at individual selling prices. The terms of payment usually provide for payment within days of invoicing.\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Group essentially generates the following revenue:\n\n- Revenue from the sale of goods: Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised at the time of delivery, because control is transferred to the customer at this point in time. Payment is due upon delivery.\n- Revenue from the provision of services: Revenue from the provision of services is recognised at a point in time when the contractually agreed service is performed. Where an invoice is issued, the right to payment arises after the provision of a service.\n- Revenue from customer-specific construction contracts: There are contracts with customers that regulate the provision of services over a certain period of time. In the case of these customer-specific contracts, advance payments and payments according to the progress of the project are generally agreed with the customer. The analysis of these contracts has shown that, in accordance with IFRS , revenue is recognised according to the progress of performance based on the ratio of the costs already incurred to the estimated total costs until the performance obligation has been met in full using the percentage of completion (POC) method. If one of the parties to the contract with the customer has fulfilled its contractual obligations, a contract asset, a contract liability or a receivable is recognised, depending on the relationship between the provision of services by the Group and payment by the customer. Contract assets and liabilities are recognised as current as they are incurred within the normal operating cycle. An expected loss from a contract is recognised immediately as an expense. In the percentage of completion method, the assessment of the degree of completion is of particular importance. The resulting material estimates include the estimated total costs, the total estimated revenue and the order risks. According to the percentage-of-completion method, changes in estimates can increase or decrease revenue.\n\nWarranties: As a rule, the company assumes warranty obligations only if required to do so by law or where such obligations are customary in the industry.\n\n**Advertising** – Advertising and other selling-related expenses are recognised through profit or loss when incurred.\n\n**Financial income and interest** – Interest is recognised as income or expense using the effective interest method. Interest payments are recognised in the cash outflow from financing activities. Dividend income is recognised in profit and loss at the time at which the Group's legal claim to payment arises.\n\n**Income taxes** – Income tax expense represents the sum of the current tax expense and deferred taxes. Current or deferred taxes are recognised in the consolidated income statement unless they relate to items recognised directly in equity in other comprehensive income. The current tax expense is determined on the basis of taxable income for the year. The Group's liability for current taxes is calculated based on the tax rates that are currently applicable or will be in the near future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in accordance with IAS in order to reflect the future tax effects arising from the temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated financial statements and the relevant amounts in the tax accounts. In addition, deferred tax assets are recognised as loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the statutory tax rates applicable to taxable income in the years when these temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effects of changes in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement in the financial year in which the changes to the law were adopted. Deferred tax assets are recognised only if it is likely that these assets will be recovered. Deferred taxes are measured using tax rates for future years, provided that they are specified by law or the legislative process has been essentially concluded. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if the relevant requirements of IAS are met. Under IAS , deferred taxes are classified as non-current assets or liabilities and are not discounted.\n\nCurrent income taxes are calculated based on the respective national taxable income for the year and national tax regulations.\n\n**Investment subsidies and other grants** – Grants are recognised in accordance with IAS . only if the company meets the conditions for obtaining the grant. Funds that the Group receives from public or private sources for investment or development projects are recognised as deferred income at the time of receipt. Grants for expenses are set off against the subsidised expenses in the financial year in which they are incurred. The deferred grants in the consolidated financial statements were granted for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, and for development costs. They are released through profit and loss over the useful life of the respective property, plant and equipment or intangible assets.\n\n**Earnings per share** – The profit or loss per share is calculated by dividing the consolidated net income attributable to shareholders of Eckert & Ziegler AG by the average number of shares outstanding during the financial year. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that would occur if all options to acquire ordinary shares were exercised at a price below the average share price for the period. It is calculated by dividing the portion of consolidated net income attributable to shareholders of Eckert & Ziegler by the sum of the average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year and the dilutive shares arising from the exercise of all outstanding options (calculated by applying the treasury stock method).\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Share-based remuneration** – For several years, the Group has had a remuneration plan in place that provides for compensation in shares. Under this plan, members of the Executive Board and selected employees receive a portion of their performance-based remuneration components in the form of shares. The expenses for equity-settled share-based payments for employees (treasury shares) are recognised at fair value on the grant/commitment date. This expense is recognised in personnel expenses over the period in which the service is rendered and, if applicable, the performance conditions are met (the vesting period). This share-based payment is recognised in accordance with IFRS with a corresponding increase in equity (retained earnings). The Group launched an employee share purchase programme (ESPP) on January to give employees a direct stake in the company's success. The share-based payment anchored in the ESPP is also recognised in equity in accordance with IFRS .\n\n**Segment reporting** – Pursuant to the so-called \"management approach\", the segment reporting of the Eckert & Ziegler Group is geared to the internal organisational and reporting structure. The Group has three segments: the Medical segment, Isotope Products segment and Other segment.\n\n**Currency translation** – Transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of a business unit are recognised in the functional currency at the mean spot exchange rate on the date of initial recognition. At the end of the reporting period, the company measures monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in the functional currency at the mean spot exchange rate applicable at that time. The company recognises gains and losses from these foreign currency measurements in the income statement. Non-monetary consolidated balance sheet items in foreign currencies are recognised at historical exchange rates.\n\n**Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies (IAS )** – The financial statement of an entity whose functional currency is the currency of a hyperinflationary economy are adjusted to account for the changes in the currency's purchasing power and restated. As part of the inflation adjustment, the non-monetary balance sheet items (including equity) and the profit and loss accounts are adjusted by the change in the index [Internal Wholesale Price Index (IPIM) published by the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INDEC)], since the date the assets were recognised up to the reporting date. By contrast. monetary items, such as liquid assets, trade receivables and trade payables, are not indexed, i.e. their carrying amounts do not change. The inflationary gain or loss in the reporting period is recognised in the income statement in the financial result. The adjustment to equity caused by inflation as well as currency translation differences are netted within cumulative other comprehensive income and recognised under \"Foreign currency translation differences\". In Argentina, prices in December , measured by the consumer price index, rose by . compared to the same month in the previous year. This means that the inflation rate in December was above for the eleventh month in a row.\n\n**Discontinued operations** – A part of the Eckert & Ziegler Group whose business activities and cash flows can be clearly distinguished operationally and for accounting purposes from the remaining business activities is recognised as a \"discontinued operation\" if it has either been sold or is classified as \"held for sale\". Discontinued operations are presented in a separate item in the consolidated income statement as the result of discontinued operations after taxes. If an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the consolidated income statement and the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the comparative year are adjusted as if the operation had been classified as such from the beginning of the comparative year.\n\n### **Changes in reporting compared to previous year**\n\n### **Recognition in the balance sheet of receivables from \"Percentage of completion\" under \"Contract assets\" or \"Contract liabilities\" instead of \"Inventories\" and \"Advance payments received\"**\n\nIn the financial year, POC receivables, i.e. the work performed by the Group in connection with customer-specific construction contracts, were netted with the advance payments received on an order-related basis for the first time. If the POC receivables are higher than the advance payments received, the balance is reported under \"Contract assets\" (, thousand as at December ). Conversely, if the advance payments received are higher than the POC receivable, the balance is reported under \"Contract liabilities\" (, thousand as at December ). The previous year's figures were adjusted accordingly. Until , the POC receivables (, thousand as at December ) were still reported under \"Inventories\" and the advance payments (, thousand as at December ) were reported unnetted under \"Advance payments received\".\n\n### **Recognition in the income statement of the loss in accordance with IAS (hyperinflation)**\n\nDue to the high inflation in Argentina, the Group applies IAS . The financial statements of Tecnonuclear SA, Argentina, whose functional currency is the Argentinian peso, are adjusted to the current purchasing power at the end of the reporting period. Transactions for all individual months of and non-monetary items are revalued at the end of the reporting period to reflect the current price index on the reporting date. In accordance with IAS , the monetary loss of , thousand has been recognised as a separate item in the income statement below the operating result in the financial result since the Annual Report. This results in a more reliable presentation of the Group's earnings position. The previous year's loss of , thousand was adjusted accordingly. In the annual financial statements, this item was still recognised under \"Other operating expenses\".\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **4 | NEWFINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS**\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comply with all IASB, IFRIC, and SIC standards that are required to be applied in the EU as at the reporting date.\n\nThe following new or amended standards are mandatory for financial years beginning on or after January :\n\n| IFRS standard                 | Topic

standards will affect the Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations. The exact extent of the impact on the Group cannot yet be reliably determined. The Group intends to apply IFRS as of the mandatory date, provided that this has been recognised as part of the endorsement process.\n\n### **5 | CONSOLIDATION METHODS**\n\nThe Group usesthe acquisition method of accounting for capital consolidation in accordance with IFRS and IFRS . Initial consolidation takes place at the time of acquisition, i.e. when control over the acquired company is obtained. Control is obtained by the company when it can exercise the authority to make decisions concerning the company, is exposed to fluctuating yields from its participation and is able to influence the amount of yields based on its authority to make decisions. The acquired assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at their fair values as at the acquisition date. The historical cost of the acquired interests is subsequently offset against the pro rata revalued equity of the subsidiary. Any resulting positive difference is reported as goodwill under intangible assets, while a negative difference is recognised immediately after review through profit or loss in the income statement.\n\nAll material assets and liabilities, income and expenses, and inter-company results between affiliated undertakings are eliminated in the course of consolidation. Joint ventures and associates are included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method. Profit or loss components attributable to non-controlling interests are reported separately in the net income for the period.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe gain or loss and all elements of other consolidated net income are allocated to the shareholders of Eckert & Ziegler AG and the non-controlling interests. This is done even when it results in a negative balance for the non-controlling interests.\n\nInclusion in the consolidated financial statements ends when the company ceases to have control of the subsidiary. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of in the course of the year are included in the consolidated income statement and in other consolidated net income according to the date of acquisition or disposal.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are drawn up in euros, which is the Group's reporting currency. All amounts are listed in thousands of euros ( thousand), unless noted otherwise. In this regard, commercial rounding when adding amounts may result in insignificant rounding differences. The percentages shown are calculated on the basis of the respective amounts in thousands of euros. All included financial statements of the subsidiaries were prepared as at the reporting date for the annual financial statements of Eckert & Ziegler AG. Comparative figures for the previous year were calculated in accordance with the same principles.\n\n### **6 | SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION**\n\nThe subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements are:\n\n|                                                                            | Voting rights |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Eckert & Ziegler Isotope Products Holdings GmbH, Berlin                    | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Umweltdienste GmbH, Braunschweig *                        | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Environmental Services Ltd., Didcot, United Kingdom *     | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Nuclitec GmbH, Braunschweig *                             | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Isotope Products Inc., Valencia, USA *                    | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Analytics Inc., Atlanta, USA *                            | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Brasil Participações Ltda., São Paulo, Brazil *           | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Brasil Comercial Ltda., São Paulo, Brazil *               | 100%          |\n| Ambientis Radioproteção, São Paulo, Brazil*                                | 100%          |\n| Tecnonuclear SA, Buenos Aires, Argentina *                                 | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Isotope Products GmbH, Berlin *                           | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Isotope Products SARL, Les Ulis, France *                 | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Cesio s.r.o., Prague, Czech Republic *                    | 88.90%        |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Chemotrade GmbH, Düsseldorf *                             | 100%          |\n| Gamma-Service Recycling GmbH, Leipzig *                                    | 100%          |\n| Gamma-Service Medical GmbH, Leipzig *                                      | 100%          |\n| ISOTREND spol s.r.o., Prague, Czech Republic *                             | 100%          |\n| GBT Finanzen GmbH, Dresden *                                               | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Radiopharma GmbH, Berlin                                  | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Eurotope GmbH, Berlin *                                   | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Radiopharma Inc., Hopkinton, MA, USA *                    | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Radiopharma Projekte UG (limited liability), Berlin *     | 100%          |\n| Isotope Technologies Dresden GmbH, Dresden *                               | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler BEBIG GmbH, Berlin                                        | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler BEBIG SARL, Paris, France *                               | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler BEBIG Ltd., Didcot, Great Britain (liquidated) *          | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Iberia S.L.U., Madrid, Spain *                            | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Portugal S.A.,Lisbon, Portugal (formerly Medwings S.A.) * | 100%          |\n| NRT Germany GmbH, Berlin *                                                 | 100%          |\n| Pentixapharm AG, Würzburg                                                  | 99.54%        |\n| Myelo Therapeutics GmbH, Berlin*                                           | 99.54%        |\n\n*\\* Indirect participation*\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **7 | CHANGES TO THE SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION**\n\nIn the financial year, the following company interests were acquired or sold and changes were made to the scope of consolidation (acquisitions are presented in Note ):\n\n- On November , Eckert & Ziegler signed a : joint venture agreement with the Chinese pharmaceutical company DongCheng Pharma (DC Pharma). DC Pharma acquired a million stake in the EZAG subsidiary Qi Kang Medical Technology (Changzhou) Co., Ltd. by way of a capital increase and holds of its shares as at December . Qi Kang Medical Technology is only accounted for using the at-equity method as at December . As the capital increase only took place at the end of the year, the profit and loss account of the subsidiary was still fully consolidated. Income of . million was recognised from the deconsolidation as at December .\n- Eckert & Ziegler BEBIG Ltd, Didcot, UK, was liquidated in December . The removal from the commercial register will not take place until . The company has not been active for a long time and was already dissolved last year.\n- As part of the preparations for the spin-off of the clinical assets (Pentixapharm AG and Myelo Therapeutics GmbH), , shares (.) in Pentixapharm AG were sold by Eckert & Ziegler AG on November . The profit and loss transfer agreement dated June concluded between Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG as the controlling company and Pentixapharm AG (following the conversion of Pentixapharm GmbH) was terminated by law with effect from December due to the participation of an outside shareholder in accordance with Section AktG. As a result, the Group now only owns . of Pentixapharm AG and its subsidiary Myelo Therapeutics GmbH.\n\n### **8 | INTERESTS IN JOINT VENTURES**\n\nA joint venture is based on a contractual agreement in which the Group and other contracting parties undertake a business venture under common leadership; this is the case if the strategic financial and business policies pursued in the joint venture require the consent of all parties. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. The consolidated income statement includes the Group's share of the income and expenses, as well as changes in the equity of participations measured at equity. If the Group's share in the loss of the joint venture exceeds the interest measured at equity, this interest is written down to zero. Further losses are not recognised unless the Group has a contractual obligation or has made payments to the benefit of the joint venture. Unrealised gains or losses from transactions by Group companies with the joint venture are eliminated against the carrying amount of the participation in the joint venture (maximum loss up to the carrying amount of the participation).\n\n### **9 | CURRENCY TRANSLATION**\n\nWith the exception of one company whose functional currency is the currency of a country with pronounced hyperinflation, the financial statements of the subsidiaries included in the Group, which are prepared in a foreign currency, are translated into euros in accordance with IAS . As the subsidiaries conduct their business affairs autonomously from a financial, economic and organisational standpoint, the functional currency of the consolidated companies corresponds to their respective national currency. Assets and liabilities are translated using the average exchange rate on the reporting date. Items in the income statement and the statement of cash flows are translated at the weighted average annual exchange rate. Equity components are translated at the historical rate when they were initially recognised. Resulting currency translation differences are recognised in a separate item in equity and under non-controlling interests without affecting profit or loss until the subsidiary is disposed of. Upon disposal of the subsidiary, all accumulated currency translation differences are reclassified to the consolidated income statement.\n\nWhen interests in a subsidiary are disposed of with no loss of control, the proportion of the currency translation differences applicable to the interests that are sold is allocated to the non-controlling interests effective on the date of disposal.\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Country | Currency | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 | Average exchange rate<br>2023 | Average exchange rate<br>2022 |\n|---------|----------|------------|------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| USA     | USD      | 1.11       | 1.07       | 1.09                          | 1.05                          |\n| CZ      | CZK      | 24.72      | 24.12      | 24.48                         | 24.57                         |\n| UK      | GBP      | 0.87       | 0.89       | 0.86                          | 0.85                          |\n| RU      | RUB      | 98.50      | 78.93      | 92.46                         | 75.66                         |\n| BR      | BRL      | 5.36       | 5.64       | 5.34                          | 5.44                          |\n| ARG     | ARS      | 893.90     | 189.69     |                               |                               |\n| CH      | CHF      | 0.93       | 0.98       | 0.94                          | 1.00                          |\n| CHN     | CNY      | 7.85       | 7.36       | 7.79                          | 7.08                          |\n\nThe following exchange rates were used for currency translation:\n\n### **10| DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS**\n\nA part of the EZAG Group whose business activities and cash flows can be clearly distinguished operationally and for accounting purposes from other business activities is recognised as a discontinued operation if it has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or represents a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.\n\nDiscontinued operations are not included in the profit/loss from continuing operations and are presented in a separate item in the consolidated income statement as profit/loss from discontinued operations after tax. If an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the consolidated income statement and the consolidated cash flow statement for the comparative year are adjusted as if the operation had been classified as such from the beginning of the comparative year\n\nIn October , the Supervisory Board of Eckert & Ziegler AG gave its approval to the Executive Board to prepare a spin-off of up to per cent of the shares in Pentixapharm AG. Pentixapharm AG and its subsidiary Myelo Therapeutics GmbH form the division that comprises the Group's clinical assets. The focus here is on the development of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. This division will be discontinued and the spin-off is being prepared. In accordance with the provisions of IFRS , the non-current and current assets and liabilities of Pentixapharm AG and Myelo Therapeutics GmbH are recognised as discontinued operations. In view of the enormous growth forecast for active pharmaceutical ingredients, Eckert & Ziegler intends to pool its financial resources to expand its global manufacturing capacities and concentrate on its core competences in order to further expand its position as a leading supplier of radioisotopes for the production of radiopharmaceuticals.\n\nDue to the upcoming spin-off of the division, the assets and liabilities will be classified as held for sale and reported separately in the balance sheet as at December . In accordance with IFRS , the division is presented as discontinued operations as at December . The expenses and income of this division are therefore recognised in \"Earnings after taxes from discontinued operations\". No impairment losses were recognised when classifying this division as held for sale.

For foreign companies, the prevailing local tax rates were applied when calculating deferred taxes.\n\nDeferred taxes are based on the differences between the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements for assets and liabilities and the corresponding amounts included in the tax accounts of the respective individual Group companies. In addition, they apply to any tax loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities were offset in the balance sheet to the extent permitted under IAS .\n\nDeferred tax expenses of , thousand (previous year: , thousand) and deferred tax income of , thousand (previous year: , thousand) are attributable to the change in tax loss carryforwards in the year under review, while deferred tax income of , thousand (previous year: deferred tax expenses of , thousand). is attributable to temporary differences.\n\nIn total, , thousand (previous year: , thousand) deferred taxes on tax loss carryforwards were capitalised. The loss carryforwards mainly relate to loss carryforwards of the German companies of the Eckert & Ziegler Group totalling , thousand. The losses in Germany, the US and Brazil can be carried forward indefinitely. The loss carryforwards in Argentina ( thousand) and the Czech Republic ( thousand) are limited to years.\n\nOf a total of , thousand in deferred tax assets on loss carryforwards, , thousand (previous year: , thousand) are attributable to companies that still suffered a tax loss in but are expected to generate a profit in the future. In contrast to the previous year, loss carryforwards of thousand were used in the financial year, for which no deferred tax assets for loss carryforwards were recognised as at December of the previous year. As at December , the Group had loss carryforwards of , thousand (previous year: , thousand) for continuing operations for which no deferred tax assets were recognised, as it is unlikely that they can be used due to the uncertain earnings forecast or the planned discontinuation of operating activities in the future.\n\nCurrency translation resulted in changes in deferred taxes on temporary differences totalling thousand (previous year: thousand).\n\nIn the year under review, deferred tax income of thousand (previous year: – thousand) was recognised directly in equity in connection with actuarial gains and losses from the measurement of pension provisions.\n\nDeferred tax assets totalling , thousand were recognised in the consolidated balance sheet due to the presentation of business divisions held for sale (Pentixapharm AG and Myelo GmbH).\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\nNo deferred tax liabilities were recognised for temporary differences from retained earnings of subsidiaries amounting to , thousand (previous year: , thousand) as Eckert & Ziegler AG is in a position to control the timing of the reversal and the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to individual items in the balance sheet are presented in the following table:\n\n|

As a significant portion of the goodwill is attributable to companies in the Isotope Products segment that prepare their accounts in US dollars, the slight change in the US dollar slightly increased the overall effect.\n\nSpecifically, goodwill is allocated to the segments and to the cash generating units as follows:\n\n|                                       | Goodwill | Goodwill |\n|---------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| € thousand                            | 2023     | 2022     |\n| Isotope Products segment              | 24,536   | 25,970   |\n| Medical segment                       | 11,187   | 11,240   |\n| thereof Medical Devices business unit | 8,395    | 8,395    |\n| thereof other segment business units  | 2,792    | 2,845    |\n| Other                                 | 0        | 5,931    |\n| As at 31 December                     | 35,723   | 43,141   |\n\nCapitalised goodwill was tested for impairment in accordance with IAS in the financial year. Goodwill was allocated to the relevant *cash generating units* (CGU). These represent the lowest level at which goodwill and assets are monitored for corporate management purposes. The Isotope Products segment constitutes a CGU. The Medical segment includes several business units (BUs), each of which constitutes a CGU.\n\nThe value in use of the cash generating units is derived from the discounted future cash flows that were determined based on the current five-year budgets. For the subsequent period, the cash flows were calculated using a growth rate of (previous year: ). The pre-tax discount rate was . for the Isotope Products segment and . for the CGUs in the Medical segment. The discount rate after taxes for the Isotope Products segment was . (previous year: .) and . for the CGUs of the Medical segment (previous year: .).\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\nA need to recognise impairment losses was not identified as at December . Impairment testing as at December identified one need to recognise an impairment loss based on the respective recoverable amounts, namely thousand for the Medical Devices BU.\n\nThe outcome of impairment testing for the goodwill of the Isotope Products segment and the other Medical segment BUs (Pharma, Laboratory Equipment, Plant Engineering) was that there are no conceivable potential changes to key assumptions that could result in the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeding the recoverable amount.\n\nBecause the *headroom*, as the difference between the carrying amount of the CGU including goodwill and the recoverable amount, was low in the goodwill impairment test for the Medical Devices BU and because an impairment loss was recognised for this BU in the previous year, the results of the scenario analysis are presented here:\n\n- Scenario : If the discount rate after taxes is points higher (. instead of .), there is still no need to recognise an impairment loss.\n- Scenario : If the variable cost of sales were to increase by and at the same time the BU were to keep its prices constant and not take any measures to reduce fixed costs, an impairment loss of , thousand would be necessary.\n- Scenario : If revenue were lower than assumed but the relative margin remained the same and the BU did not take any measures to reduce fixed costs at the same time, an impairment loss of , thousand would be necessary.\n\t- b) Amortised intangible assets for the financial years ended December and , respectively, consisted of the following:\n\n()Acquired intangible assets\n\n|                                    | 2023<br>€ thousand | Remaining amortization<br>period | 2022<br>€ thousand |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Customer relationships             | 4,172              | 2–5 years                        | 6,439              |\n| Licenses/software/permits          | 8,285              | 1–5 years                        | 6,357              |\n| Patents/technology                 | 0                  |                                  | 4                  |\n| Development projects (in progress) | 0                  |                                  | 33,938             |\n| As at 31 December                  | 12,457             |                                  | 46,738             |\n\nThe difference between the purchase price of the interests in Pentixapharm AG (formerly Pentixapharm GmbH) and the carrying amounts recorded at the time of acquisition was recognised in as \"Acquired intangible assets\" under \"Development projects (in progress)\", since the acquired object was not a business within the meaning of IFRS . In connection with the final allocation of the purchase price for the acquisition of Myelo Therapeutics GmbH, , thousand was also recognised under the \"Development projects (in progress)\" item. At the end of , these development projects totalling , thousand were reclassified to the \"Assets held for sale\" balance sheet item due to the planned spin-off of the clinical assets.\n\n()Internally generated intangible assets\n\n|                                    | 2023<br>€ thousand | Remaining amortisation<br>period | 2022<br>€ thousand |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Software/approvals                 | 599                | 3–10 years                       | 647                |\n| Patents/technology                 | 0                  |                                  | 0                  |\n| Development projects (in progress) | 0                  |                                  | 6,480              |\n| As at 31 December                  | 599                |                                  | 7,127              |\n\nIntangible assets are amortised using the straight-line method. They are allocated in the income statement to cost of sales, selling expenses, general administrative costs and other operating expenses according to the functional area of the respective intangible assets (also see the remarks in Note ).\n\n### **27 |PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT**\n\nThe development of property, plant and equipmentfrom January to December is shown in the statement of changes in fixed assets attached to the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAdditions in the financial year mainly related to investments in land and buildings as well as production facilities for the purpose of building up new production capacities in America and Europe, the expansion and modernisation of existing production facilities, as well as ongoing replacement investments. In the financial year, self-constructed production facilities totalling , thousand (previous year: , thousand) were capitalised.\n\nAs at December , no property, plant and equipment or real estate had been deposited or pledged as collateral.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **28 | LEASING**\n\nThe Group leases various office, warehouse and production buildings and related outdoor facilities and vehicles. The Group concludes leases that have fixed terms with renewal options and that have indefinite terms with specified termination notice periods or revolving renewal options after the expiry of the minimum term. In all of these cases, the Eckert & Ziegler Group specifies the lease term where it is reasonably certain that it will exercise the renewal option or not exercise the termination option.\n\nThe specification of the lease term constitutes a critical estimate. The Executive Board considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise a renewal option or not exercise a termination option. In particular, it takes into account the fact that the production programmes and the work with radioactive material make it necessary to stay in one location for an extended period of time. Against this background, the exercise of the renewal option or the non-exercise of the termination option has tended to be classified as reasonably certain if the exercise or non-exercise of these options is dependent on the decisions of the Group and there are no other facts and circumstances to the contrary.\n\nThe balance sheet shows the following amounts relating to leases:\n\n| € thousand          | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n|---------------------|------------|------------|\n| Right-of-use assets |            |            |\n| Land and buildings  | 28,176     | 25,277     |\n| Outdoor facilities  | 95         | 341        |\n| Vehicles            | 657        | 877        |\n|                     | 28,928     | 26,495     |\n| Lease liabilities   |            |            |\n| Short-term          | 2,596      | 2,690      |\n| Long-term           | 27,320     | 24,497     |\n|                     | 29,916     | 27,187     |\n\nThe income statement shows the following amounts relating to leases:\n\n| € thousand                                                   | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Depreciation of right-of-use assets                          |            |            |\n| Buildings                                                    | 2,624      | 2,553      |\n| Outdoor facilities                                           | 48         | 42         |\n| Vehicles                                                     | 388        | 383        |\n| Total (see also Note 17)                                     | 3,060      | 2,978      |\n| Interest expenses (see also Note 22)                         | 840        | 618        |\n| Expenses not include in the measurement of lease liabilities |            |            |\n| For short-term leases                                        | 234        | 200        |\n| For leases for low-value assets                              | 165        | 151        |\n\nIn , lease liabilities gave rise to payments of , thousand (: , thousand), of which , thousand (: , thousand) was for the principal portion and thousand (: thousand) was for the interest portion.\n\nThe following outflows are expected in subsequent years from recognised leases (undiscounted amounts):\n\n| € thousand                                       | 31/12/2023 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Due within one year                              | 3,561      |\n| Due later than one year but less than five years | 12,899     |\n| Due later than five years                        | 20,145     |\n| Total (undiscounted)                             | 36,605     |\n\n### **29|OTHERNON-CURRENT ASSETS**\n\nOther non-current assets are financial assets, which mainly comprise the asset value of various reinsurance policies totalling thousand (previous year: thousand) and security deposits paid in the amount of thousand (previous year: thousand).\n\nTo hedge the interest rate risk associated with a . million loan over five years with a variable interest rate based on the -month Euribor, the Group concluded an interest rate cap with Deutsche Bank AG on May . As with the loan, this interest rate cap has a nominal value of million, a duration of five years, and a similar repayment structure. The strike takes place when the -month Euribor reaches .. However, since the terms of the interest rate cap are only partially consistent with those of the loan, the cap is not accounted for as a hedge. The fair value of the interest rate cap was recognised under \"Other non-current assets\" at thousand (previous year: thousand).\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **30| INTERESTS IN ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES**\n\nThe Group's participations measured at equity consisted of participations in the following associates:\n\n- ZAO NanoBrachyTech, Dubna, Russia\n- Nuclear Control & Consulting GmbH, Leipzig\n- ZAO Ritverc, St. Petersburg, Russia\n- Atom Mines LLC, Austin Texas, USA\n- BEBIG Medical GmbH, Berlin\n- Qi Kang Medical Technology Co.

OOO BEBIG is supplied by Eckert & Ziegler BEBIG GmbH (see also the remarks in Note ). Apart from the participation in OOO BEBIG, NBT is not engaged in any other significant business activities. Eckert & Ziegler BEBIG GmbH exercises significant influence over ZAO NanoBrachyTech both through its voting rights and through its supplying of OOO BEBIG, and it accounts for this participation as an associate. Because of the restrictions introduced by Russia in July concerning the foreign repatriation of income from participations in Russian companies, as well as the increased risk of capital loss in the case of associates in Russia, the at-equity interests in associates domiciled in Russia were written down by .

Similar to NBT, the investment is valued at a discount of . Dividends received in the financial year in the amount of thousand were recognised directly in equity.\n\nOn January , Eckert & Ziegler Radiopharma GmbH acquired . of the interests in Atom Mines LLC, Texas, USA, Atom Mines LLC is a manufacturer of ytterbium. Eckert & Ziegler Radiopharma GmbH has concluded an exclusive, long-term contract with it for the supply of ytterbium-. As a result, the Group has a significant influence on Atom Mines LLC; this explains why the company is consolidated using the at-equity method (IFRS .) despite a shareholding of less than . In , the company posted a loss of thousand.\n\nWith effect from March , Eckert & Ziegler BEBIG GmbH disposed of its HDR business, which it had previously spun off to BEBIG Medical GmbH. In this respect, it sold of the interests in BEBIG Medical GmbH to TCL Healthcare Equipment, Shanghai. The stake in BEBIG Medical GmbH remaining in the Group has since been consolidated at-equity in the Eckert & Ziegler Group. At the end of , the provisional profit of BEBIG Medical GmbH amounted to , thousand (previous year: , thousand).\n\nThe following tables provide an overview of the summarised financial information with respect to significant participations measured at-equity:\n\n#### **Joint venture Qi Kang Medical Technology Co., Ltd.

In addition, there are defined benefit plans for individual employees of a German company in the Medical segment and a pension commitment for the widow of a former member of the Executive Board.\n\nThe Group has concluded reinsurance policies as part of these plans. Where these have been assigned to employees, the reinsurance policies are reported as plan assets netted against the pension provisions. Claims under reinsurance policies that have not been assigned are reported as non-current assets.\n\nThe type and amount of benefits payable under the pension plans are specified in company agreements (pension schemes). Essentially, these are either old-age pensions or one-off payments, which are paid to employees by the employer after they have left the company and reached the specified age limit.\n\nThe Group's pension plans are exposed to risks from changes in actuarial assumptions, such as actuarial interest rates, salary and pension trends, and longevity risk. A lower discount rate leads to higher pension obligations. Similarly, lower than expected performance of the plan assets could lead to a deterioration in the funded status.\n\nThere were no significant changes to these defined benefit plans in the and .\n\nIn accordance with IAS (revised), pension obligations were calculated using the projected unit credit (PUC) method and recognised at the present value of the pension entitlements earned on the measurement date, including expected future pension and salary increases.

The adjusted interest rates are between . and . (previous year: . and .). If the previous year's interest rates of . to . had been maintained, the provision would have been , thousand lower (previous year: , thousand higher).

These provisions are created based on the anticipated internal and external costs of processing, which are regularly reviewed and updated. Cost calculation is based on empirical values and past costs for disposal. The extrapolation of historical costs into the future involves estimation uncertainties, in particular due to\n\n- uncertainty relating to future measurements of underlying disposal channels, the degree of usability and related external costs.\n- inability to take into account potential amendments in legal and/or regulatory requirements affecting both internal expenses as well as external disposal costs.\n- valuation risks due to the use of flat-rate price increases and fixed discount rates.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\nOther non-current provisions also include , thousand (previous year: , thousand) for long-term services still to be rendered for the fulfilment of various contracts, thousand in provisions for impending losses from pending transactions (previous year: thousand), personnel-related provisions (from long-service anniversaries and long-term bonuses) of thousand (previous year: thousand), provisions for clearance measurement and restoration in the amount of thousand (previous year: thousand) and archiving provisions in the amount of thousand (previous year: thousand).\n\nOther non-current provisions developed as follows in the and financial years:\n\n| € thousand                   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Provisions as at 1 January   | 28,855 | 28,887 |\n| Additions                    | 6,395  | 4,398  |\n| Disposals                    | 59     | -745   |\n| Compounding                  | 566    | 5      |\n| Utilisation                  | -3,667 | -3,690 |\n| Currency translation         | 0      | 0      |\n| Provisions as at 31 December | 32,208 | 28,855 |\n\nOther current provisions totalling , thousand (previous year: , thousand) mainly relate to the current portion of radioactive waste requiring disposal.\n\n### **41 |OTHERNON-CURRENT LIABILITIES**\n\nOther non-currentliabilities decreased year-on-year from , thousand to , thousand. The liabilities remaining as at December mainly relate to non-current liabilities from the acquisition of shares in Tecnonuclear SA, Argentina, to former shareholders in the amount of , thousand. The non-current liability from the acquisition of Myelo Therapeutics GmbH (, thousand) as at December is now recognised at a value of , thousand due to the final PPA under the \"Liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale\" item.\n\n### **42 |ADVANCEPAYMENTS RECEIVED**\n\nIn connection with contracts with customers, the Group companies receive advance payments that are recognised as current liabilities. The advance payments received of , thousand reported as at December were largely realised as revenue in the financial year. As at December , , thousand was reported as advance payments received.

As at December , the fair value of the derivative asset (measurement hierarchy level ) from the interest rate cap was thousand (previous year: thousand). The fair value of the interest rate cap was determined using a standard market interest rate option valuation model, taking market parameters into account.\n\nFinancial liabilities measured at fair value included the following items:\n\n• Liabilities from contingent purchase price payments from company acquisitions within the meaning of IFRS in the amount of , thousand as at December . The fair value of these liabilities is determined on the basis of the agreed conditions for variable purchase price determination and taking into account the estimated probability of occurrence of these conditions (measurement hierarchy level ).\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Measurement category under IFRS 9** € thousand **2023** 2022 **Financial assets measured at amortised cost** Interest income 830 220 Impairment losses (–)/reversals of impairment losses (+) –139 –565 Foreign exchange gains (+)/foreign exchange losses (–) 1,795 2,859 2,486 2,514 **Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss** Impairment losses (–)/reversals of impairment losses (+) –369 427 **–369 427 Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost** Interest expenses –1,146 –745 Foreign exchange gains (+)/foreign exchange losses (–) –2,240 –1,560 **–3,386 –2,305 Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss** Interest expenses 0 0 Impairment losses (+)/reversals of impairment losses (–) 0 0 **0 0**\n\nThe net gains and losses recognised in accordance with IFRS are shown in the following table:\n\n#### **Risk analysis**\n\nThe Group is exposed to financial credit, default, liquidity and market risks in the course of business operations. Market risks relate, in particular, to interest rate and foreign exchange risks.\n\n### **Credit risk**\n\nCredit risk or default risk means the risk that a customer or counterparty of Eckert & Ziegler Group cannot meet its contractual obligations. The result of this is, firstly, the risk of value impairments on financial instruments due to issues of credit rating and, secondly, the risk of partial or complete loss of contractually agreed payments.\n\nThe Group is mainly exposed to credit and default risk based on its trade receivables. Risk is primarily influenced by the size of the customer and the country-specific rules and practices for processing the reimbursement of medical services by public authorities.\n\nAs a general rule, the Group obtains a credit rating for new customers, and first deliveries are only made against advance payment. Deliveries to customers that are considered a permanent risk due to their size or location are secured by advance payments or letters of credit. Credit and default risk is monitored as part of a Group-wide risk management system, which involves a regular analysis of overdue trade receivables.\n\n#### **Risk exposure**\n\nThe maximum default risk corresponded to the carrying amount of the trade receivables as at the reporting date in the amount of , thousand (previous year: , thousand).\n\nAs at the reporting date, a geographic breakdown of the maximum credit exposure with respect to current trade receivables was as follows:\n\n| € thousand        | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|\n| Europe            | 19,890 | 19,010 |\n| North America     | 13,866 | 9,900  |\n| South America     | 3,112  | 3,947  |\n| Asia/Pacific      | 5,864  | 0      |\n| Other             | 988    | 4,314  |\n| As at 31 December | 43,720 | 37,171 |\n\nThe risk of default is considered to be low. Due to the manageable number of customers, individual receivables items can be easily identified as impaired so that the Group recognises impairments in relation to expected loss events as well as objective indications of impairment, such as impending insolvency, if necessary. Expected probabilities of default are of secondary importance for the Group.\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following classification of impaired receivables results from the analysis of receivables due and overdue:\n\n| € thousand                    | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Receivables not yet due       | 34,666 | 23,096 |\n| Past due 1 to 90 days         | 6,382  | 11,010 |\n| Past due by more than 90 days | 3,581  | 4,654  |\n| Trade receivables             | 44,629 | 38,760 |\n| Value adjustment              | -909   | -1,589 |\n| Net trade receivables         | 43,720 | 37,171 |\n\nThe change in impairment losses recognised for trade receivables was as follows:\n\n| € thousand        | 2023  | 2022  |\n|-------------------|-------|-------|\n| As at 1 January   | 1,589 | 1,210 |\n| Net additions     | -680  | 379   |\n| As at 31 December | 909   | 1,589 |\n\nThe reduction in impairments is mainly due to a payment from a customer whose receivables that have been overdue for years were recognised as not recognised in the past.\n\nSave for trade receivables, the balance sheet does not contain any overdue or impaired financial assets. The Group considers the default risk of these other financial assets to be very low.\n\n### **Liquidity risk**\n\nLiquidity risk means the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations on time. The purpose of liquidity management is to ensure that adequate amounts of borrowed and own funds are available all times. As part of the Group's financial planning, a liquidity forecast is prepared, which can be used, among other things, to identify additional debt financing needs in advance. The Group generates its financial resources predominantly through its operating activities. As at December , Eckert & Ziegler AG and its subsidiaries also had access to cash credit lines of , thousand (previous year: , thousand) if required. These credit lines had not been drawn down. The Group also has guarantee lines totalling , thousand (previous year: , thousand) of which , thousand (previous year: , thousand) was freely available as at December .\n\nAs at the reporting date, the consolidated balance sheet shows liabilities to banks totalling , thousand (previous year: , thousand) that must be repaid within years. In and , external financing was requested from banks or submitted independently by banks for various projects. The various loan offers contained favourable terms and conditions, which leads to the conclusion that the Group has a good credit rating. The Executive Board believes this is because of the Group's solid financing with a high equity ratio and the favourable prospects of the operating units. In addition to the high equity ratio, solid balance sheet ratios further underpin the Group's creditworthiness, as non-current assets are more than covered by equity and non-current liabilities.\n\nBased on its access to third-party financing and the forecast of liquidity requirements, it can be inferred that the Group currently has adequate financial resources to ensure its continued existence as a going concern. The Group also believes that it is in a position to meet all payment obligations, even if a slight increase in the debt ratio is necessary in the coming financial years in order to secure growth through further acquisitions, develop new locations and finance new product developments.\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Risk exposure**\n\nThe contractually agreed due dates for financial liabilities are as follows:\n\n| ANALYSIS OF THE CONTRACTUALLY AGREED DUE DATES 31/12/2023 |                        |                 |            |                             |              |              |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|------------|-----------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| € thousand                                                |                        | Carrying amount | Fair value | Cash outflow (amortisation) |              |              |\n|                                                           |                        |                 | Total      | up to 1 year                | 2 to 5 years | over 5 years |\n| Loan liabilities                                          | fixed interest rate    | 8,888           | 8,431      | 1,352                       | 7,536        | 0            |\n| Loan liabilities                                          | variable interest rate | 17,500          | 17,500     | 5,000                       | 12,500       | 0            |\n| Trade payables                                            | non-interest bearing   | 5,868           | 5,868      | 5,868                       | 0            | 0            |\n| Other liabilities                                         | non-interest bearing   | 3,947           | 3,947      | 3,947                       | 0            | 0            |\n| Derivative financial liabilities                          | variable interest rate | 0               | 0          | 0                           | 0            | 0            |\n| As at 31 December                                         |                        | 36,203          | 35,746     | 16,167                      | 20,036       | 0            |\n\n#### ANALYSIS OF THE CONTRACTUALLY AGREED DUE DATES 31/12/2022\n\n| € thousand                       |                        | Carrying amount | Fair value | Cash outflow (amortisation) |              |              |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|------------|-----------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                  |                        |                 | Total      | up to 1 year                | 2 to 5 years | over 5 years |\n| Loan liabilities                 | fixed interest rate    | 6,400           | 6,095      | 0                           | 6,400        | 0            |\n| Loan liabilities                 | variable interest rate | 16,000          | 16,000     | 0                           | 16,000       | 0            |\n| Trade payables                   | non-interest bearing   | 8,340           | 8,340      | 8,340                       | 0            | 0            |\n| Other liabilities                | non-interest bearing   | 15,519          | 15,519     | 15,519                      | 0            | 0            |\n| Derivative financial liabilities | variable interest rate | 0               | 0          | 0                           | 0            | 0            |\n| As at 31 December                |                        | 46,259          | 45,954     | 23,859                      | 22,400       | 0            |\n\nThe cash outflows for the variable-interest liabilities in were based on an interest rate of M-euribor +. (previous year: .).\n\n### **Foreign exchange risks**\n\nThe Group's international business activity exposes it to foreign exchange risks resulting from the influence of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions as well as assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency (transaction risks).\n\nThe main foreign currency transactions in the Eckert & Ziegler Group relate to the US dollar as a result of loan repayments and dividend payments of the US-based subsidiaries and the export business of the German subsidiaries. This effect is only partially offset by the operating activity of several subsidiaries that buy components and goods mainly in US dollars and then sell the end products mainly in euros.\n\nIf necessary, export transactions in foreign currencies are hedged using foreign exchange options and forward transactions. There were no open positions under forward exchange options or forward transactions as at the reporting date.\n\n#### **Risk exposure**\n\nAs at the reporting date, the Group's exposure to transaction risk was as follows:\n\n| Foreign currency exposure | 31/12/2023 |       |       |     |       | 31/12/2022 |       |       |     |       |\n|---------------------------|------------|-------|-------|-----|-------|------------|-------|-------|-----|-------|\n| expressed in € thousand   | USD        | GBP   | ARS   | CZK | BRL   | USD        | GBP   | ARS   | CZK | BRL   |\n| Cash and cash equivalents | 17,366     | 1,433 | 460   | 661 | 1,381 | 25,882     | 1,200 | 1,050 | 577 | 1,966 |\n| Trade receivables         | 14,114     | 520   | 1,213 | 78  | 1,713 | 11,099     | 175   | 1,721 | 220 | 1,404 |\n| Trade payables            | -1,520     | -49   | -470  | -46 | 204   | -1,651     | -64   | -759  | -78 | -239  |\n| Balance sheet exposure    | 29,960     | 1,904 | 1,203 | 693 | 3,298 | 35,330     | 1,311 | 2,012 | 719 | 3,131 |\n\n### **Sensitivity analysis**\n\nProvided that all other assumptions remain unchanged, a appreciation of the euro against the following currencies would lead to the following increases (decreases) in comprehensive income as at the reporting date:\n\n|                                | 31/12/2023 |      |      |     |      | 31/12/2022 |      |      |     |      |\n|--------------------------------|------------|------|------|-----|------|------------|------|------|-----|------|\n| effect expressed in € thousand | USD        | GBP  | ARS  | CZK | BRL  | USD        | GBP  | ARS  | CZK | BRL  |\n| Comprehensive income           | -2,724     | -173 | -109 | -63 | -300 | -3,212     | -119 | -183 | -65 | -285 |\n\nA fall in the euro against the currencies listed above would have had a similar but opposite effect on the currencies listed as at the reporting date.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe foreign exchange rates listed under Note were used as the basis for the sensitivity analysis.\n\n### **Interest rate risk**\n\nThe Group used an interest rate cap to hedge a . million loan over five years with a variable interest rate based on the -month Euribor. As with the loan, this interest rate cap has a nominal value of . million, a duration of five years, and a similar repayment structure. The strike takes place when the -month Euribor reaches .. As at December , the fair value of the derivative asset from the interest rate cap was thousand.\n\nWith regard to other interest rate risks, the Group's exposure to interest rate risk due to fluctuations in market interest rates is low for financial assets and liabilities with medium- to long-term maturities, since few of the assets and liabilities have variable interest rates.\n\nWith regard to the other items, no hedging is undertaken if a change in interest rates does not impact on cash flow.\n\n### **Risk exposure**\n\nThe Group had the following interest-bearing financial assets and liabilities as at the reporting date:\n\n| € thousand                             | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Interest-bearing financial assets      | 475    | 2,005  |\n| – thereof variable interest rate       | 0      | 0      |\n| – thereof fixed interest rate          | 475    | 2,005  |\n| Interest-bearing financial liabilities | 26,388 | 22,400 |\n| – thereof variable interest rate       | 17,500 | 16,000 |\n| – thereof fixed interest rate          | 8,888  | 6,400  |\n\n#### **Sensitivity of the cash flows for variable-interest financial instruments**\n\nAn increase in the market interest rate by basis points on the reporting date – keeping all other assumptions the same – would have led to the following increase (decrease) in the net profit or loss for the period:\n\n|                                                    | 2023               |                    | 2022               |                    |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| effect expressed in € thousand                     | + 100 basis points | – 100 basis points | + 100 basis points | – 100 basis points |\n| Result for variable-interest financial instruments | 0                  | 0                  | 0                  | 0                  |\n\nThe zero effect arises because an interest cap in the opposite direction and of almost the same amount acts against the (mathematically expected) increase in interest expense.\n\n### **Capital management**\n\nPursuant to Section of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), Eckert & Ziegler AG (parent company) is subject to minimum capitalisation in accordance with German stock corporation and commercial law rules. Accordingly, an Extraordinary General Meeting must be called if the sum of the parent company's equity as calculated in accordance with German commercial law rules falls below of the subscribed capital. This did not materialise in the and financial years.\n\nTo finance its growth strategy, the Group uses its own liquidity and, increasingly, external financing consisting of a mix of long-term loans and short-term cash credit lines, which can be drawn down flexibly depending on need and utilisation. The focus will continue to be on securing the Group's financing for the coming periods.\n\nThe Group pursues a conservative investment and borrowing policy geared towards flexibility and maintains a wellbalanced investment and financing portfolio. The Group is not subject to any external capital requirements. Ensuring the Group's liquidity and creditworthiness, including guaranteed access to the capital market at all times, and effectively increasing the company value are the main financial management objectives.\n\nMeasures to achieve these goals include capital structure optimisation, the dividend policy, acquisitions, and, if necessary, equity measures. Capital requirements and capital procurement should be coordinated in a manner that takes requirements in terms of earnings, liquidity, security, and autonomy into appropriate consideration. The Group's overall strategy has remained unchanged compared to .\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-95-0\"></span>**NOTES CONCERNING THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS**\n\nCash and cash equivalents reported in the consolidated statement of cash flows include cash and cash equivalents reported on the balance sheet, consisting of cash on hand, cheques, balances with financial institutions and all highly liquid assets with a residual maturity of no more than three months from the date of acquisition.\n\nThe consolidated statement of cash flows shows how the cash and cash equivalents of the Eckert & Ziegler Group changed during the financial year as a result of cash inflows and outflows. In accordance with IAS (Statement of Cash Flows), cash flows in the consolidated statement of cash flows are divided into cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.\n\nChanges in the balance sheet items examined for the development of the consolidated statement of cash flows are adjusted for the non-cash effects of currency translation and changes to the scope of consolidation. Furthermore, investing and financing transactions that did not have an impact on liquid assets are not included in the statement of cash flows. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, the changes in the respective balance sheet items reported in the consolidated statement of cash flows cannot be compared directly with the corresponding values in the published consolidated balance sheet.\n\n### **45 | OPERATINGACTIVITIES**\n\nCash inflows and outflows are determined indirectly, based on consolidated net income after taxes. Net income after taxes is adjusted for non-cash expenses and supplemented by changes in assets and liabilities.\n\n### **46 | INVESTING ACTIVITIES**\n\nCash flows from investing activities are calculated based actual payment transactions. They include cash flows related to the acquisition, production and sale of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment not included in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n### **47 | FINANCING ACTIVITIES**\n\nCash flows from financing activities are calculated based on actual payment transactions and include the taking out and repayment of loans and other financial liabilities, lease liabilities as well as cash flows between the Group and its shareholders, such as dividend payments.\n\nThe Group has elected to classify interest paid and interest received as cash flows from financing activities in accordance with IAS ..\n\n### **Discontinued operations**\n\n| € thousand                                | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Cash flow from operating activities       | 2,197      | -3,654     |\n| Cash outflow from investing activities    | -4,940     | -4,046     |\n| Cash inflow from financing activities     | 11,358     | 5,456      |\n| Cash outflow from discontinued operations | 8,615      | -2,244     |\n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-96-0\"></span>**OTHER DISCLOSURES**\n\n### **48 |OTHERFINANCIAL OBLIGATIONSAND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND RECEIVABLES**\n\nThe Group's most important companies issue letters of comfort to third parties in order to secure the liabilities and obligations of affiliated companies (e.g. under leases or as a contract performance guarantee). Directly enforceable maximum-sum guarantees are also provided to secure all claims under surety and credit lines as well as under loan agreements of subsidiaries. The company does not expect any claims under these.\n\nThe following events are of importance:\n\nWhen the German Radiation Protection Act (StrlSchG) entered into force on January , the supervisory authority was given the ability to require the posting of security for legacy facilities as well. This security also relates to radioactive materials that originate from handling. In December , Eckert & Ziegler Nuclitec GmbH, as licence holder for the Braunschweig location, was ordered to post security of . million. In order to avoid tying up liquidity at the overall Group level of Eckert & Ziegler, this security was posted in the form of a letter of comfort from EZAG, which was sent on time to the competent supervisory authority for approval. The draft of this letter of comfort is still awaiting approval by the authorities.\n\nAnother subsidiary received a licence to handle other radioactive substances in summer in accordance with Section () no. of the Radiation Protection Act (StrSchG). In August , the company issued a letter of comfort to the Free State of Saxony, represented by the Saxon State Office for Agriculture, Environment and Geology (LfULG), to secure the obligation of this subsidiary to dispose of such radioactive substances resulting from the handling of the licence. The obligation is limited to , thousand.\n\nIn addition, Eckert & Ziegler Radiopharma GmbH provided a letter of comfort to the lessor of an affiliate, stating it is at all times capable of properly removing the radioactive waste temporarily stored at the leased property or of temporarily storing it elsewhere.\n\n### **49| SEGMENT REPORTING**\n\nIn accordance with IFRS , operating segments must be separately identified based on the Group's internal management reporting. These internal segments are those that are regularly audited by the Group's main decision-makers with regard to decisions about the distribution of resources to this segment and the assessment of its financial performance.\n\nThe individual segments offer different products and are also organisationally separated by location. The applied accounting standards of the individual segments are consistent with those described in the summary of the main accounting policies (Note ). Segment information is not consolidated. This corresponds to the information used by the Executive Board as part of regular management reporting. Intra-group leases are not accounted for in accordance with IFRS , and no corresponding right-of-use assets or lease liabilities are thus recognised under segment assets or segment liabilities. Transactions between the segments are settled at market prices.\n\nThe **Isotope Products** segment manufactures and distributes standards and radiation sources for medical and industrial purposes. Standards are radioisotopes for calibration purposes. They are generally sold to scientific institutions. Industrial radiation sources are found in various measuring equipment for industrial facilities and other measuring devices, for example, safety equipment at airports and in crude oil exploration. They are sold to the manufacturers or operators of plants and systems. The medical radiation sources include radioactive sources for the calibration of gamma cameras. The production sites for this segment are located in Europe and in North and South America. Worldwide revenue and distribution also takes place from these locations. In addition, the segment offers a variety of services: taking back sources from customers and accepting low-level isotope technology waste, e.g. from hospitals and other facilities, processing and conditioning of radioactive waste, recycling of isotope technology material, transport and logistics, arranging service technicians for the inspection, maintenance and commissioning of irradiation systems, professional disposal of waste and restoration. This means that the Isotope Products segment offers the entire range of services relating to radiation sources for medical and industrial purposes.\n\nIn the **Medical** segment, the largest share of revenue is generated from pharmaceutical-quality radioactive ingredients that play a diagnostic or therapeutic role as part of a medication. The most important items include the Ge/Ga radionuclide <sup>68</sup>Ge/<sup>68</sup>Ga radionuclide generator GalliaPharm<sup>®</sup>, which enables the radioactive labelling of carrier molecules for the purpose of the sensitive diagnosis of various types of cancers, and the therapeutic isotopes yttrium-, lutetium- and phosphorous-. Yttrium- has a number of uses, such as in the production of radioactive embolizers for the treatment of liver tumours\n\nIn addition, the segment markets products designed for radiation therapists, a group of doctors that is specialised in treating cancer through irradiation. The two most important products are small implants for the treatment of prostate cancer based on iodine- (so-called \"seeds\") and eye applicators based on ruthenium- and iodine- for the treatment of uveal melanomas (eye cancer).\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, the Medical segment includes a project business directed at international medication developers, which provides them with support in the development and approval of new radiopharmaceuticals, the manufacture of test batches, and the development of production facilities and the associated infrastructure. The business is grouped around a plant engineering department located in Dresden, whose range of products is supplemented by laboratory equipment, radiosynthesis equipment, quality-control equipment and consumables, as well as a wide array of services.\n\nThe **Other** segment comprises the items of the holding company Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG as well as Pentixapharm AG and Myelo Therapeutics GmbH.\n\n| SEGMENT REPORTING                                           |  |                  |         |         |        |        |        |             |        |         |

id=\"page-105-0\"></span>**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR´S REPORT**\n\nTo Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG, Berlin\n\n### **Audit opinions**\n\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as of 31 December 2023, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated cash-flow statement for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the group management report of Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. In accordance with German legal requirements we have not audited the content of those parts of the group management report listed in the \"Other information\" section of our auditor's report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e (1) HGB and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as of 31 December 2023, and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, and\n- the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the group management report does not cover the content of the parts of the group management report listed in the \"Other information\" section of our auditor's report.\n\nPursuant to § 322 (3) sent. 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\n{106}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Basis for the audit opinions**\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014, referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW) [Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer in Deutschland. Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\n# **Key audit matters in the audit of the consolidated financial statements**\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon, we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\n# *IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL*\n\n# **Related information in the consolidated financial statements**\n\nFor information on the accounting and valuation principles applied to goodwill, please refer to the disclosures in section 3 \"Significant accounting and valuation principles\" (\"Goodwill\" and \"Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment\") in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Quantitative disclosures on goodwill are included in the notes to the consolidated balance sheet in section 26 \"Intangible assets\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n# **Facts and risk for the audit**\n\nGoodwill amounting to € 35.7 million is reported in the consolidated financial statements of Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG. Goodwill represents 17 % of non-current assets.\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\nGoodwill is subjected to an annual impairment test by the company in order to determine a possible need for amortization. As a result of the impairment test, there was no need for impairment in the reporting year. The result of these valuations depends to a large extent on how the legal representatives estimate future cash surpluses and derive the discount rates used in each case. Due to the uncertainties underlying the valuation and the subjective assumptions and estimates used in the valuation, the recoverability of goodwill is a key audit matter in the context of our audit.\n\n### **Audit approach and findings**\n\nAs part of our audit, we analyzed the process implemented by the Executive Board of Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG and the accounting policies for determining the recoverable amounts of cash-generating units to which goodwill was allocated for potential risks of error with the support of our company's valuation specialists and obtained an understanding of the process steps. We assessed the Company's methodology for determining the capitalization rates and for deriving the fair values.\n\nWe analyzed the corporate planning by comparing it with the results actually achieved in the past and current developments in the business figures. We verified the key assumptions of the corporate planning regarding growth and business development by discussing them in detail with the management of Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG. On this basis, we assessed their appropriateness.\n\nWe analyzed the parameters used to determine the discount rates with regard to their appropriate derivation and verified their calculation in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36.\n\nWe used sensitivity analyses to assess impairment risks in the event of changes in significant valuation assumptions. We also verified the mathematical accuracy of the valuation models in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36.\n\nOn the basis of our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors with regard to the recoverability of goodwill are justified and balanced.\n\n# *DISCLOSURE AND MEASUREMENT OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS*\n\n### **Related information in the consolidated financial statements**\n\nInformation on discontinued operations can be found in section 10 \"Discontinued operations\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in section 1.1 \"Group business model\" of the Group management report.\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Facts and risk for the audit**\n\nIn October 2023, the Supervisory Board of Eckert & Ziegler AG granted the Executive Board its approval for a spin-off of up to 100 % of the shares in Pentixapharm AG. Pentixapharm AG and its subsidiary Myelo Therapeutics GmbH form the division comprising the Group's clinical assets, which is to be discontinued in the future and was classified as a discontinued operation in accordance with IFRS 5 from this date. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements of Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG show assets classified as held for sale in the Clinical Assets division in the amount of € 65.3 million and associated liabilities classified as held for sale in the amount of € 21.8 million. A result from discontinued operations of € -3.7 million is reported in the consolidated income statement for the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe allocation of the assets, liabilities, expenses and income of the Clinical Assets division and therefore the disclosure as a discontinued operation in accordance with IFRS 5 are complex. In addition, there is a risk for the consolidated financial statements that the valuation of the disposal group is not appropriate. With regard to the explanatory disclosures on the discontinued operation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, there is a risk that the presentation is not sufficiently detailed and appropriate. The recognition and measurement of the discontinued operation Clinical Assets was therefore a key audit matter in the context of our audit.\n\n### **Audit approach and findings**\n\nWe assessed the process initiated to spin off the division on the basis of the company's documentation and by interviewing the Management Board and the Supervisory Board. As part of our audit, we also assessed whether the assets and liabilities as well as the income and expenses of Pentixapharm AG and Myelo Therapeutics GmbH were correctly allocated to the discontinued operation. In order to assess the valuation of the assets classified as held for sale, we reviewed the final valuation and purchase price allocation reports commissioned by the Company for the assets of Myelo Therapeutics GmbH with the support of our company's valuation specialists. Furthermore, with regard to the recoverability of the assets, we inspected the current status of the documents of the valuation expert commissioned by the company to prepare the spin-off, analyzed them, verified the key valuation parameters and had the expert explain the procedure to us. In addition, we assessed whether the presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the Group management report on the discontinued operation is sufficiently detailed and appropriate.\n\nOn the basis of our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors with regard to the allocation of assets and liabilities as well as expenses and income and thus the presentation of the Clinical Assets division as a discontinued operation in accordance with IFRS 5 and with regard to the recoverability of the assets classified as held for sale are appropriate. The presentation of the discontinued operations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements is sufficiently detailed and appropriate.\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\n# *MEASUREMENT OF PROVISIONS FOR RESTORATION OBLIGATIONS AND PROVISIONS FOR DISPOSAL OBLIGATIONS*\n\n**Related information in the consolidated financial statements**\n\nInformation on provisions can be found in section 3 \"Significant accounting policies\" (\"Provisions\") and in section 40 \"Other provisions\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n**Facts and risk for the audit**\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements of Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG, provisions for decommissioning obligations amounting to € 35.9 million are reported under \"Other non-current provisions\". In addition, provisions for the obligation to process own radioactive waste and radioactive waste accepted from third parties as well as take-back obligations for sold radiation sources (hereinafter referred to as \"provisions for disposal obligations\") amounting to € 28.8 million are reported under \"other non-current provisions\" and € 6.4 million under \"other current provisions\".\n\nGroup companies of Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG produce isotope technology components, irradiation equipment and radiopharmaceuticals in their own and in rented buildings, as a result of which the production facilities and buildings used for this purpose are contaminated. Due to existing obligations to restore the site to its condition prior to decontamination, provisions must be recognized for restoration obligations.\n\nIn the production process of Group companies of Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG, radioactive waste is produced and, in addition, Group companies of Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG accept radioactive waste from third parties for disposal. Provisions must be formed for these disposal obligations.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 37, the provisions must be measured on the basis of the best possible estimate of the expenses associated with the obligation as at the balance sheet date. All risks and uncertainties must be taken into account. Non-current provisions must be discounted to the present value of the expenses on the reporting date.\n\nThe calculation of the decommissioning and disposal obligations is based on various assumptions, which are based on estimates that essentially relate to the following parameters:\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) [and supplementary compliance with the ISAs] will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our [audit] opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e (1) HGB.\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n- evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n- perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the actions taken or safeguards applied to eliminate independence threats.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS**\n\n# **REPORT ON THE ASSURANCE ON THE ELECTRONIC RENDERING, OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT, PREPARED FOR PUBLICATION PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH § 317 (3A) HGB**\n\n# **Assurance opinion**\n\nWe have performed assurance work in accordance with § 317 (3a) HGB to obtain rea-sonable assurance as to whether the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report (hereinafter the \"ESEF documents\") contained in the attached electronic file 391200EUDABLUKXCKG48-2023-12-31-de (MD5-hash value: 87ab035fe55f4d69e6f5f0a4446712f2) and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of § 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format (\"ESEF format\").

The advantages are obvious. Although we are a German company, we operate primarily on a European and international level. Structural adjustments, cooperations and the expansion of our growing business can be implemented even more efficiently as an \"SE\" than before. Although the change of name is important, I can assure you that our mission statement, \"Contributing to saving lives\", will remain unchanged in the future.\n\nMore important than this change in legal form is the new record that Eckert & Ziegler achieved in the past financial year with sales of almost € 250 million. We are very satisfied with this ongoing positive development, as 2023 was also a challenging year for Eckert & Ziegler in many respects: geopolitical upheaval, high inflation rates, rising interest rates and energy prices, to name just a few adversities. Nevertheless, as an isotope specialist, we performed well across all segments.\n\nToday, we employ over 1,000 people. That's quite a journey! A good ten years ago, we still had 500 employees under contract and achieved a turnover of € 100 million. Since then, both the number of EZAG employees and our turnover have doubled.\n\nThe driving force behind our business continues to be the unbroken high demand for radiopharmaceuticals for nuclear medicine. Last year, we expanded our product range by the isotope lutetium-177, which is important for cancer treatment. This means that we now provide all common nuclides for our customers. The flagship product, the gallium generator, achieved another sales record thanks to continued strong demand. This year, we will launch actinium-225 on the market, once again demonstrating our leading position in the field of isotope production. Part of this positive development is our plant engineering division in Dresden, which is now making a significant contribution to the Medical segment's sales growth.\n\nThe Isotope Products segment's performance also improved in 2023. The backlog of customer orders caused by the pandemic was cleared and made up for. The signs are once again pointing to growth in 2024. The segment recorded continuous growth, particularly in the area of calibration sources for nuclear medicine and isotope supply. Demand for radiation sources for the energy sector also increased in 2023 despite the recessionary pressure; we are expecting this to continue in the current year.\n\nLast but not least, various investment projects around the globe have kept us busy. We are not only expanding our sites in North and South America. In Germany and China, we are also moving full steam ahead after the corona break. Together with our Chinese joint venture partner, we are expanding our core expertise in this important market. Nevertheless, the era of cheap money is over. Even more reason to manage not only investments but also the total capital involved in such a way that the funds tied up remain within reasonable limits.\n\nChanges have also been made to the corporate structure: the founder of Eckert & Ziegler, Dr Andreas Eckert, moved from the Executive Board to the Supervisory Board after more than 30 years and since then has accompanied us with commitment and dedication. Over the past few months, the newly appointed Executive Board has held intensive discussions with both the Supervisory Board and all management levels about the company's future strategy. This also included the decision to focus more\n\n{4}------------------------------------------------\n\nImage /page/4/Picture/0 description: This image shows a man in a suit and tie. The text in the upper left corner reads \"Eckert & Ziegler Annual Report 2023 LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS\". The number 3 is in the upper right corner.\n\nstrongly on core competencies in future: The production and sale of radioisotopes. Adjacent areas such as Pentixapharm or Myelo no longer fit into this spectrum despite their promising prospects and led to the communicated spin-off decision.\n\nThe future looks optimistic. Recent drug developments in the pharmaceutical industry and the increasing number of radiopharmaceutical companies are promising. In recent months, the capital market has finally opened up again – many companies active in the development and marketing of diagnostic and therapeutic drugs have either been able to secure financing or have been acquired entirely by Big Pharma. Both of these developments are positive for us, as they will further increase the demand for radioisotopes in the future. That will benefit us and we are already preparing for this within our investment planning.\n\nOur success is based on the strong commitment of our employees in 13 countries and on our cornerstones such as diversity, inclusion and equal opportunities. The different experiences and perspectives of our employees enrich our corporate culture, promote creativity and innovation and help us to offer our customers needs-based solutions. A working environment in which everyone is given the opportunity to develop and realize their potential without harassment, discrimination or disadvantage is therefore essential for us.

GROUP FUNDAMENTALS**\n\n# **1.1 BUSINESS MODEL OF THE GROUP**\n\nThe Eckert & Ziegler Group (Eckert & Ziegler) is an international manufacturer of isotope technology componentsfor medical, scientific and industrial applications. In addition to Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG, a listed German stock corporation with its registered office in Berlin, the Group comprises additional companies, including minority interests. The Group is managed by the Executive Board, which is supported in its decisions by the advice of the Extended Executive Board, which consists of the Executive Board of Eckert & Ziegler AG and the heads of select business divisions.\n\nThe company's core competencies include the handling and processing of isotope technology materials in specially equipped and approved production facilities in Europe, the United States, Brazil and Argentina. Eckert & Ziegler develops, produces and sells medical devices for cancer therapy as well as radionuclides for nuclear medicine applications and synthesis equipment for the production of radiopharmaceuticals. Plant engineering and the retrieval of isotope technology waste from hospitals and research institutions round out the portfolio.\n\nThere are comparatively few providers in the international markets where Eckert & Ziegler operates. As its competitors serve only specific market niches, Eckert & Ziegler has no direct competitor offering the same range of products. The market is characterised by high barriers to market entry due to licensing requirements as well as rapid technological progress, considerable research expenditure and constant new scientific discoveries. This market is regulated by German federal, state and local authorities. These regulatory authorities include the Regional Office for Health and Social Affairs Berlin (LAGeSo), the Technical Monitoring Agency (TUV Nord CERT GmbH, Essen), the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM), and the corresponding foreign institutions, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). As a result, the Group is directly affected by changes in technology and in products used in cancer treatment and for nuclear medical imaging, by government regulations related to the industry in which Eckert & Ziegler operates, and by the general environment within the health care sector.\n\nThe operating business is managed through subsidiaries in the two operational segments Medical and Isotope Products, which target different customer groups with their various product groups. The Other segment includes the holding company, which pools internal group services such as Radiation Protection, Legal, Accounting, IT and HR, as well as Pentixapharm AG and its subsidiary Myelo Therapeutics GmbH. In October , the Supervisory Board of Eckert & Ziegler AG gave its approval to the Executive Board to prepare a spin-off of up to per cent of the shares in Pentixapharm AG. Pentixapharm AG and its subsidiary Myelo Therapeutics GmbH form the division that comprises the Group's clinical assets. The focus here is on the development of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. This division will be discontinued and the spin-off is being prepared. In accordance with the provisions of IFRS , the noncurrent and current assets and liabilities of Pentixapharm AG and Myelo Therapeutics GmbH are recognised as discontinued operations. In view of the enormous growth forecast for active pharmaceutical ingredients, Eckert & Ziegler intends to pool its financial resources to expand its global manufacturing capacities and concentrate on its core competences in order to further expand its position as a leading supplier of radioisotopes for the production of radiopharmaceuticals.\n\nThe Isotope Products segment manufactures isotope technology components for imaging techniques, scientific applications, quality assurance and industrial measurement purposes. In addition, the segment offers a variety of services: taking back of radiation sources from customers and receiving low-level isotope technology waste, for example, from hospitals and other institutions, processing and conditioning of radioactive waste, recycling of isotope technology materials, transport and logistics, provision of service technicians for inspection, maintenance and commissioning of irradiation facilities, professional disposal of waste and restoration. With the acquisition of the Argentinian company Tecnonuclear S.A., the product range now includes SPECT diagnostics, consisting of technetium- generators and a portfolio of related biomolecules.\n\nThe segment's most important locations are in Valencia and Atlanta (USA), São Paulo (Brazil), Buenos Aires (Argentina), Prague (Czech Republic), and Braunschweig, Dresden and Leipzig (Germany).\n\nIn the Medical segment, the majority of revenue is attributable to pharmaceutical-grade radioactive substances that fulfil diagnostic or therapeutic functions as part of a drug and to drug products. The most important items include the <sup>68</sup>Ge/<sup>68</sup>Ga radionuclide generator GalliaPharm<sup>®</sup>, which enables the radioactive labelling of carrier molecules for the purpose of the sensitive diagnosis of various types of cancers, and the therapeutic isotopes yttrium-, lutetium- and phosphorous-. Yttrium- has a number of uses, such as in the production of radioactive embolizers for the treatment of liver tumours.\n\nWith its own GMP facilities, the Medical segment offers a variety of radiopharmaceutical services under GMP and cGMP conditions, all from a single source. These include complete early-development services, including process development \n\n{20}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-20-0\"></span>and scale-up, CMC manufacturing and packaging, product approval and stability programmes. As a contract radiopharmaceutical manufacturer, Eckert & Ziegler is capable of providing small batches for phase I, II or III clinical trials as well as large batch sizes for commercial use.\n\nIn addition, the segment markets products designed for radiation therapists, a group of doctors that is specialised in treating cancer through irradiation. The two most important products are small implants for the treatment of prostate cancer based on iodine- (\"seeds\") and eye applicators based on ruthenium- and iodine- for the treatment of uveal melanomas (eye cancer).\n\nFinally, the Medical segment includes a project business directed at international medication developers, which provides them with support in the development and approval of new radiopharmaceuticals, the manufacture of test batches as well as the development of production facilities and the associated infrastructure. The business is grouped around a plant engineering department located in Dresden, whose range of products is supplemented by laboratory equipment, radiosynthesis equipment, quality-control equipment, and consumables, as well as a wide array of services.\n\nThe segments' markets and various products are only loosely connected with each other. Each has its own cycles and distinctive characteristics. There are also national differences in the overall conditions. This is particularly the case with medical products whose intensity and dynamics of demand are influenced by the level of services provided by national healthcare systems and the presence of local competitors.\n\nIn the medium term, the Group is expected to continue to grow sustainably and profitably. The Group intends to achieve this on the one hand through organic growth, based for example on the (continued) development of new and existing products, or by entering into new geographical markets. On the other hand, the Group seeks opportunities for profitable acquisitions and aims to generate revenue by improving efficiency.\n\n# **1.2 BUSINESS MODEL OF ECKERT & ZIEGLER STRAHLEN- UND MEDIZINTECHNIK AG**\n\nEckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG operates as a financial and management holding company and as a strategic development partner for its subsidiaries; it does not conduct its own business operations. The main sources of revenue are therefore service fees, interest and profits distributed by or transferred from the subsidiaries.\n\n# **1.3 MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**\n\nThe Executive Board manages the Group's production and revenue companies. It sets the course for strategic development, makes important decisions with the managing directors, and monitors subsidiaries' achievement of targets.\n\nThe long-term business plan for the Group is drawn up for five financial years and is updated annually on the basis of the previous year's figures. The annual individual business plan is bottom-up and is based on the business plans for each business division prepared by the respective managing directors together with the Executive Board. Detailed targets are formulated with regard to predefined control parameters and key performance indicators for the individual production and revenue companies. These individual business plans take into account estimates regarding the development of the industry.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of each financial year, the Executive Board submits to the Supervisory Board a detailed annual Group business plan for the following financial year. Ongoing monitoring of the budget variables takes place as part of central quarterly reporting.\n\nThe Controlling segment prepares reports for the business divisions and monitors performance in relation to planning, with particular focus on the key performance indicators of revenue and annual net income. The controllers report directly to the Group Executive Committee on a quarterly basis with a structured financial report on quantitative and qualitative developments in the reporting period. From the financial year, \"EBIT before special items from continuing operations\" will be used as a second performance indicator in addition to revenue instead of net income for the year. Focussing on these two parameters provides a better assessment of the operating performance of the core business without special items, i.e. without effects that are special in terms of their nature and amount for the management of the Group. These include financial and currency results, losses in accordance with IAS (hyperinflation), acquisition costs, divestments and restructuring. When calculating this key figure, EBIT from continuing operations is increased by extraordinary expenses and reduced by extraordinary income. As a result, the forecast for the financial year will also be converted to these key performance indicators.\n\nThe financial management of the Group largely takes place at the segment level, with some differences in the implementation.\n\nAt regular meetings, the Executive Board gathers information about the market situation and sets the course in coordination with managing directors and segment heads. A comprehensive review of the annual business plan is carried out once a year.\n\n{21}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-21-0\"></span>**1.4 RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT**\n\nTotal expenditure forresearch and development, including capitalised development costs increased from . million in the previous year to . million in . Most of this is attributable to the companies Pentixapharm AG and Myelo Therapeutics GmbH, which are recognised as discontinued operations. Expenditure on research and development increased from . million in the previous year to . million in , of which . million was capitalised.\n\nThe other development costs totalling . million (previous year: . million) are attributable to the core business. In the Isotope Products segment, they remained at the previous year's level at around . million, while expenses in the Medical segment increased by . million to . million. No development costs were capitalised in these two segments.\n\nIn the financial year, an average of employees worked in the development departments across the Group (previous year: ).\n\nAs in the previous year, the contribution to revenue made by products that have been added to the portfolio in the last years is .\n\nThe interlocking of the development departments of the business divisions creates synergies. This makes it even easier to implement specific customer requests. For customers' proprietary radiodiagnostics and radiopharmaceuticals, Eckert & Ziegler can offer, for example, all developmental steps: from development of the chemical manufacturing process to production of the process module required for this purpose (cassette) to suitable synthesis equipment that can be used to manufacture the medication in the hospital and dispense it to patients.\n\n### **1.4.1 MEDICAL SEGMENT**\n\n### **Radiopharma business division**\n\nEckert & Ziegler has entered into a long-term cooperation with the Nuclear Physics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Ústav jaderné fyziky (UJF), for the production of the alpha emitter actinium- (Ac-). The agreement stipulates that Eckert & Ziegler will provide the UJF research centre with several million euros for investments in equipment and hot cells as well as radium- (Ra-) as a starting material for tests and irradiation. In return, Eckert & Ziegler will receive exclusive access to the production capacities of a pilot plant being built near Prague, as well as coutilisation rights to process steps being developed for large-scale commercial Ac- production.\n\nThe Braunschweig site is therefore investing in production processes to make Ac- available in drug quality for clinical trials and subsequently for commercial applications.\n\nIn view of the planned start of production of Ac- in , several supply contracts for this nuclide were concluded with pharmaceutical customers in the past year.\n\nEckert & Ziegler received GMP manufacturing authorisation for the therapeutic nuclide lutetium- (Lu-) at its site in Braunschweig in and also submitted a Drug Master File (DMF) to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The company succeeded in concluding a strategically important contract with a well-known pharmaceutical company for the supply of this isotope over a period of years.\n\nThe GMP facility built at the Berlin site was technically commissioned and must now be approved by the authorities as a pharmaceutical production facility. It will enable Eckert & Ziegler to offer complete early-development services, including process development and scale-up, CMC development, manufacturing and packaging, product approval and stability programmes. It will also put the company in a position to operate as a contract manufacturer of clinical-standard radiopharmaceutical products for phase I, II and III trials as well as for commercial use.\n\nThe production process for the therapeutic nuclide yttrium- (Y-) was further expanded in Wilmington, MA, USA (Greater Boston area).\n\nEckert & Ziegler is also continuing to invest in the development of a process for the production of ytterbium- (Yb-), an indispensable precursor for the production of Lu- that is only available in very small quantities. This production process, which was partly financed by Eckert & Ziegler and developed by Atom Mines LLC (Texas, USA), is intended to resolve the bottleneck and enable Eckert & Ziegler to offer Lu- in large quantities to pharmaceutical companies all over the world.\n\n### **Laboratory Equipment business division**\n\nUntil now, synthesis devices such as Modular-Lab systems and standardised sterile cassettes for single-dose production have been manufactured for hospitals in particular. In addition to this routine business, new fields of application were opened up for synthesis devices.\n\nFor instance, Eckert & Ziegler now builds customised automation solutions for the nuclide labelling of diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals with adapted hardware and software modules on behalf of pharmaceutical and radiopharmaceutical companies.\n\n{22}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe company is also further developing the Modular-Lab system so that it can be used as a platform for mRNA synthesis and purification of novel, non-radioactive cancer drugs.\n\nIn the reporting period, the transfer of device production for the quality control of radiopharmaceuticals from the USA to the Berlin site was successfully completed and of these devices were manufactured. This corresponds to an increase of around compared to the previous year. The quality control application area for alpha emitters has become increasingly important. The development focus on qualifying the device portfolio for these applications has proven to be the right decision and will be continued. A good market position for these devices, particularly in the USA, will benefit Eckert & Ziegler's business development as a supplier of the promising alpha emitter Ac-.\n\nOrganisational measures were continued in the clean room production area for cassettes in order to meet the requirements of GMP-compliant production of customer-specific cassettes. The company SCINTOMICS Molecular, Applied Theranostics Technologies GmbH has audited and commissioned Eckert & Ziegler Eurotope GmbH as a contract cassette manufacturer. Contract manufacturing for this customer is planned for the long term and is to be expanded by at least one cassette type in .\n\n### **1.4.2 ISOTOPE PRODUCTS SEGMENT**\n\nThe Isotope Products business division continued its close relationships with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in the field of medical imaging and expanded its product portfolio of SPECT/CT and PET/CT products. Two types of point sources for Siemens have been developed and launched on the market. One of these is an Se- source and is used at the Siemens plant for quality control in the manufacture of collimators. The second is an Na- source, a modification of an existing source that is compatible with Siemens software. In addition, two Co- line sources for Spectrum Dynamics scanners (D-SECT and VERITON) were modified and released for the needs of the Japanese market. Further OEM sources for PET imaging of the brain are in the final testing and design control phase. In response to customer demand, the design of the phantom shield has been improved and a counterweight hinge has been added, making the device much easier and safer to use. These shields are of particular importance for the mobile PET market, as additional shielding is required, especially during road transport.\n\nDue to the geopolitical tensions in Europe and the Middle East and the resulting risk of disruption to the supply chain, the Isotope Products segment continued to see the need to further diversify its sources of supply for key raw materials. This year, the focus was on radioisotopes, but also included non-radioactive components. Ge- and Co- are essential for the production of PET and SPECT sources for the medical imaging market, which is why additional sources were qualified here in particular. Diversifying the supply chain and reducing the number of sole suppliers for key materials remains a priority.\n\n{23}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-23-0\"></span>**2. BUSINESS REPORT**\n\n# **2.1 BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND NET ASSETS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE GROUP**\n\n### **2.1.1 Business development of the Group**\n\nIn , the Eckert & Ziegler Group set a new record with revenue of . million. Compared to the previous year, revenue increased by . million or . Adjusted for currency effects, revenue increased by . million or .\n\nThe Radiopharmaceuticals business remains the biggest growth driver, with growth of to . million across all segments.\n\nAccording to estimates, this market for nuclear medicine will continue to grow many times over in the coming years. In view of this strong growth forecast for active pharmaceutical ingredients, which is already reflected in revenue, Eckert & Ziegler intends to pool its financial resources to expand its global manufacturing capacities. In October the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of Eckert & Ziegler AG therefore decided to dispose of the Group's clinical assets. The Supervisory Board has given its approval to the Executive Board to examine and prepare a spin-off of up to per cent of the shares in Pentixapharm AG. Eckert & Ziegler is concentrating on its core competences in order to further expand its position as a leading supplier of radioisotopes for the production of radiopharmaceuticals.\n\nEckert & Ziegler brought together numerous renowned experts in Boston in June for the first Boston Radionuclide Theranostics Forum. Potential and existing partners as well as key players in the industry discussed the central topics of the rapidly developing radiotheranostics market. The forum focussed on discussions about solutions to challenges in the areas of supply chains, upscaling, patient access and the latest theranostic concepts.\n\nIn addition to the steadily developing core business, contracts or reservation agreements were concluded with various customers over the course of the year for the supply of the latest radioisotopes in Eckert & Ziegler's portfolio, lutetium and actinium-. One example of this is a contract signed in September with POINT Biopharma Global Inc. for the supply of no carrier added lutetium- (n.c.a. Lu). The agreement has a term of ten years with total revenue volume of more than million.\n\nThe revenue target of million expected in the forecast report for was exceeded.\n\n### **Revenue development with external customers in detail**\n\nAt . million, revenue in the Isotope Products segment was on a par with the previous year (previous year: . million), meaning that the segment remains the Group's largest segment in terms of revenue. In the Medical segment, revenue increased by . million or to . million compared to the previous year.\n\nWith revenue of . million (previous year: . million), the Americas remain the most important revenue region in the financial year. In terms of consolidated revenue, it contributed to revenue (previous year: ). The largest single national market for Eckert & Ziegler products in was once again the United States, where goods worth . million were sold compared to . million in the previous year. Revenue in Europe also rose by . million to . million, with the share of consolidated revenue amounting to (previous year: ). Germany remained the most important European market with . million (previous year: . million).\n\nWhile sales in the Medical segment rose in Europe (), sales in the Isotope Products segment in the region remained just below the previous year's level (–). In the Americas, the Group recorded growth totalling , with growth distributed across the segments as follows: Medical , Isotope Products –. Business in Asia grew by across all segments compared to the previous year, making it the fastest growing region.\n\nSales are mainly invoiced in EUR. Total EUR revenue accounted for (previous year: ), USD revenue (previous year: ) of consolidated revenue.\n\n### **2.1.2 Financial performanceof the Group**\n\nAt . million, the consolidated net income in the reporting period was . million or below the previous year's figure. The share of earnings attributable to shareholders of Eckert & Ziegler AG amounts to . million, which corresponds to . per share. Of the consolidated net profit, a loss of . million (previous year: . million) was attributable to discontinued operations.\n\nThe main growth driver remains the strong business with pharmaceutical radioisotopes, leading to an overall increase in the gross margin of . million to . million. Selling expenses rose by . million or to . million, while general administrative expenses increased by . million, from . million in the previous year to . million. Other operating income fell by . million to . million; in the previous year, income of . million was recognised \n\n{24}------------------------------------------------\n\nfrom the deconsolidation of Wolf-Medizintechnik GmbH. Other operating expenses increased by . million to . million. Overall, the operating result of . million was on a par with the previous year (previous year: . million).\n\nCompared to the previous year, currency effects had a negative impact on earnings of . million more than in the previous year; the loss according to IAS (hyperinflation) decreased by . million to . million (previous year: . million). Results from the valuation of financial instruments fell by . million to –. million. As a result, EBIT fell by . million to . million.\n\nSignificantly higher interest expenses reduced net interest income by . million compared to the previous year. Earnings before taxes fell by from . million to . million. Income tax expenses fell from . million to . million. Overall, consolidated net income from continuing operations fell by . million to . million in the year under review.\n\nOf the consolidated net income from continuing and discontinued operations, . million (previous year: . million) is attributable to non-controlling interests, so that the share of earnings attributable to the shareholders of Eckert & Ziegler AG fell from . million in the previous year to . million in the year under review.\n\n### **2.1.3 Developmentof the segments**\n\n### **Isotope Products segment**\n\nThe segment's main product groups are:\n\n- () Radiation sources\n- () Tc-m generators and consumables\n- () Trade in raw isotopes and other products\n- () Services\n- () Disposal of low-level isotope technology waste\n\nThe important first product group involves isotope technology components for imaging techniques, scientific applications, quality assurance and industrial measurement purposes. Eckert & Ziegler has long possessed a solid market position with a significant share of world market volume. Radiation sources for medical quality assurance continue to grow.\n\nThe second main group comprises the Argentinian nuclear medicine specialist Tecnonuclear S.A., a manufacturer of technetium- generators and a portfolio of related biomolecules. Together with the generators, these generic tracers are often also referred to as SPECT diagnostics. Sales of Tc-m generators and consumables for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) amount to just under . million in .\n\nThe third main product group makes use of Eckert & Ziegler's purchasing leverage to resell raw isotopes to third parties at a profit.\n\nThe last two main product groups are services such as taking back sources from customers and accepting low-activity isotope technology residues, conditioning radioactive waste, recycling isotope technology material, transport and logistics, arranging service technicians for the inspection, maintenance and commissioning of irradiation facilities, professional disposal of waste and dismantling. Business development may be subject to high fluctuations due to project-related services offered. Revenue from services is mainly based on individual orders and non-recurring repeat orders.\n\nThe Isotope Products segment achieved revenue of . million, an increase of . million () compared to the previous year. While revenue with external customers was slightly below the previous year's level, internal Group revenue grew by . million.\n\nThe gross margin totalled . million (previous year: . million), which corresponds to an increase of . million or compared to . In relation to revenue, the margin developed only marginally and grew from to ; this increase is essentially due to the product mix as well as annual price adjustments and volume effects. Inflation adjustments in the hyperinflationary country of Argentina reduced earnings by . million (previous year: . million).\n\nEBIT in the year under review totalled . million, compared to . million in the previous year. Interest expenses increased by . million compared to the previous year. Tax expenses totalled . million (previous year: . million), which corresponds to a tax rate of .\n\nThe segment generated earnings before minority interests of . million, which corresponds to an increase of . million compared to .\n\n{25}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Medical segment**\n\nThe segment's main product groups are:\n\n- () Longer-lived radioisotopes for pharmaceutical applications\n- () Early-development services for radiopharmaceutical products\n- () Radiosynthesis equipment and supplies\n- () Quality control equipment\n- () Implants for the treatment of prostate cancer \"seeds\"\n- () Therapeutic accessories\n- () Ophthalmological products\n- () Other therapeutic products and plant engineering\n\nIn the Medical segment, revenue, including revenue with other segments, increased by . million or to . million. The rise was driven, in particular, by strong demand for radiopharmaceuticals.\n\nHowever, a disproportionately high increase in the cost of sales had a negative impact on the segment's gross margin, which rose by . million to . million. Continuous growth is spurring the company to make further investments in production infrastructure and human capital. Costs in connection with investments already made in the future, in particular depreciation and amortisation and personnel costs, are already having a negative impact on earnings.\n\nOverall, selling and administrative expenses were . million or higher than in the previous year. At . million, EBIT was around . million below the previous year's result.\n\nIn particular, negative currency effects totalling . million and the deconsolidation of Wolf-Medizintechnik GmbH (earnings contribution of . million in ) had a negative impact on income. In addition, interest expenses increased by . million. Tax expenses totalled . million, which corresponds to a tax rate of .\n\nThe Medical segment achieved a result of . million this year. This corresponds to an increase of . million or .\n\n### **Other segment**\n\nThe holding company Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG finances itself through services provided, such as accounting, personnel administration, IT and radiation protection; each of these is charged on to the subsidiaries plus a profit surcharge. In addition, the holding company makes loans where necessary and earns interest income from them. The holding company also receives income from profit transfers and distributions from the subsidiaries.\n\nIn addition to the holding company, the Other segment also includes the discontinued operations of the Group's clinical assets. These include Pentixapharm AG and Myelo Therapeutics GmbH.\n\nOverall, earnings before non-controlling interests fell by . million to –. million in the year under review compared to the previous year, of which . million (previous year: . million) was attributable to discontinued operations.\n\nThe founder and Chairman of the Executive Board Dr Andreas Eckert and the Chief Operating Officer of the Medical segment, Dr Lutz Helmke, stepped down from their positions at the Annual General Meeting at the beginning of June . Dr Harald Hasselmann took over the duties of both as well as the chairmanship of the Executive Board. Franklin Yeager, the long-standing head of the Isotope Products segment, who is based in California, was newly appointed to the Executive Board and is responsible for the Isotope Products segment.\n\nIn connection with the planned spin-off of Pentixapharm AG, there was a further change to the Executive Board of Eckert & Ziegler AG at the end of the year. The Executive Board member responsible for clinical development, Dr Hakim Bouterfa, left the Executive Board of Eckert & Ziegler AG at the end of the year.\n\n### **2.1.4 Financial positionof the Group**\n\nThe result for the period before minority interests for the continuing operations is . million below the previous year's result at . million.\n\nDespite the slight decrease in the result for the period, the cash flow from operating activities increased by . million to . million and almost corresponds to the result for increased by depreciation and amortisation.\n\nThe cash outflow from investing activities of continuing operations totalled . million (previous year: . million). Investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets increased from . million in the previous year to . million. . million was spent at Qi Kang Medical Technology in Jintan, China, which was deconsolidated as at December . . million was spent on acquisitions in the year under review (payment to the former shareholders of Tecnonuclear SA, Argentina), compared to . million in the previous year (acquisition of the shares in Tecnonuclear SA and Myelo Therapeutics GmbH). This was offset by cash inflows from the sale of shares in consolidated companies totalling . million (previous year: . million) and income from investments amounting to . million \n\n{26}------------------------------------------------\n\n(previous year: . million). In the previous year, cash inflows from the sale of securities totalling . million and cash outflows for the acquisition of shares in companies consolidated at equity amounting to . million (Atom Mines LLC, USA) were recorded.\n\nThe cash outflow from financing activities of continuing operations increased by . million to .million (previous year: . million) compared to the previous year. The taking out of loans resulted in a cash inflow of . million (previous year: . million). This contrasted with higher cash outflows of . million for the repayment of loans and lease liabilities (previous year: . million). The Annual General Meeting held in June resolved to issue a dividend of . (previous year: .) per share. The cash outflow for the dividend payment to the shareholders of Eckert & Ziegler AG and distributions for third-party interest therefore amounted to . million in the year under review (previous year: . million).\n\nIn addition, the relatively stronger euro (particularly in relation to the USD) led to a currency-related increase in cash and cash equivalents by . million (previous year: . million increase). Cash and cash equivalents as at December amounted to . million. Compared to the end of , this corresponds to a decrease of . million, of which . million resulted from the reclassification to discontinued operations.\n\n### **2.1.5 Net assetsof the Group**\n\nDue to the order-related offsetting of open orders valued \"at percentage of completion\" (POC) with the advance payments received, which was recognised for the first time in under the items \"Contract assets\" and \"Contract liabilities\", there was a slight balance sheet contraction. The balance sheet was adjusted accordingly.\n\nAs at December , all assets and liabilities of Pentixapharm AG and its subsidiary, Myelo Therapeutics GmbH, are reported as assets and liabilities classified as held for sale. In October , the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of Eckert & Ziegler AG decided to dispose of the Group's clinical assets. At the end of the financial year, assets totalling . million and liabilities totalling . million were allocated to the discontinued operation. The balance sheet items for will not be adjusted in accordance with IFRS regulations.\n\nThe balance sheet total as at December increased by . million and compared to the adjusted annual financial statements and now amounts to . million (previous year: . million).\n\nOn the assets side, goodwill fell by . million to . million. The decrease is mainly due to adjustments as part of the final PPA for Myelo Therapeutics GmbH. Other intangible assets decreased by . million. This decline is almost entirely due to the reclassification of the other intangible assets of Pentixapharm AG and Myelo Therapeutics GmbH to assets held for sale.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment fell by . million to . million. This was mainly due to exchange rate effects on the property, plant and equipment of the foreign subsidiaries reporting in USD and ARS. . million in asset disposals from the deconsolidation of Qi Kang Medical Technology was offset by additions to property, plant and equipment in a similar amount. The right-of-use assets in accordance with IFRS increased by . million to . million, primarily from the extension of the lease agreement for the Eckert & Ziegler AG Group headquarters building in Berlin-Buch. Shares in associated companies or joint ventures increased by . million to . million. The increase is mainly due to the addition of the joint venture formed with the Chinese pharmaceutical company DongCheng Pharma (DC Pharma) in November . DC Pharma acquired a . million stake in the EZAG subsidiary Qi Kang Medical Technology Co., Ltd. (QKM) by way of a capital increase and will hold of the shares. Accordingly, QKM, which was previously fully consolidated, has been recognised in the consolidated balance sheet under investments in associates or joint ventures since this date. Deferred tax assets increased by . million to . million. In total, non-current assets decreased by . million to . million.\n\nCurrent assets increased by . million to . million (previous year: . million). This is due in particular to the change in the presentation of previously non-current assets of Pentixapharm AG and Myelo Therapeutics GmbH under assets held for sale. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by . million compared to the end of and totalled . million. . million of the decrease is attributable to cash and cash equivalents of Pentixapharm AG and Myelo, which are reported under assets held for sale as at December (refer to the \"Liquidity\" section for details). Trade receivables increased by . million in line with the increase in revenue, while contract assets rose by . million. Inventories increased by . million to . million. At . million, other assets were roughly on a par with the previous year, while income tax receivables increased by . million to . million (previous year: . million).\n\nOn the liabilities side, non-current liabilities fell by . million to . million. Non-current bank loans decreased by . million to . million, with . million in new bank loans and . million reclassified to current liabilities, as these amounts are due for repayment in . Lease liabilities (IFRS ) increased by . million to . million. Deferred tax liabilities decreased by . million to . million and the other non-current liabilities increased by . million to . million. The decrease in both items is mainly due to the reclassifications made in connection with the planned spin-off/disposal of Pentixapharm AG. The sharp increase in other non-current provisions of . million to . million is mainly due to higher provisions for dismantling and disposal obligations. Provisions for pensions also increased, rising by . million to . million.\n\n{27}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-27-0\"></span>Current liabilities increased by . million to . million, with the majority of the increase again being attributable to reclassifications to liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale. These reclassifications are also the main cause of the changes in the items: trade payables (decrease of . million), income tax liabilities (increase of . million) and other current liabilities (decrease of . million). Other current provisions increased by . million to . million mainly due to higher provisions for short-term disposal obligations.\n\nTotal equity increased by . million to . million. Retained earnings increased by . million. The addition from the annual result of . million was correspondingly reduced by the distribution of the dividend in the amount of . million. Other reserves, which also include unrealised actuarial gains or losses in addition to translation differences on the equity of subsidiaries reporting in foreign currencies, reduced by . million, from . million to –. million. The capital reserves increased by . million to . million. The \"treasury shares\" item fell from . million to . million. The increase in the capital reserve and the decrease in treasury shares is due to the utilisation of , treasury shares in connection with share-based payments to employees and the sale of , treasury shares to Pentixapharm AG.\n\nThe equity ratio as at December was (previous year: ).\n\n# **2.2 NET ASSETS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF ECKERT & ZIEGLER STRAHLEN- UND MEDIZINTECHNIK AG – NOTES BASED ON THE GER-MAN COMMERCIAL CODE (HGB)**\n\n### **Business development of the company**\n\nIn the financial year, there was a control and profit and loss transfer agreement between Eckert & Ziegler AG as the controlling company and the affiliated company Pentixapharm AG (formerly Pentixapharm GmbH) as the controlled entity. A profit and loss transfer agreement was also in place between Eckert & Ziegler AG and Eckert & Ziegler Radiopharma GmbH, as well as between the latter and its subsidiary. The annual profit or loss generated by the other subsidiaries is not completely transferred to the parent company, meaning that the separate financial statements of Eckert & Ziegler AG differ substantially from consolidated net income.\n\n#### **Financial performance of the company**\n\nCompared to the previous year, the main changes to the income statement were as follows:\n\n- () Sales increased by . million to . million. This primarily relates to income from services and rents for affiliated companies. The year-on-year increase was due to more extensive services and charges.\n- () Other operating income increased by . million to . million. The increase is mainly due to higher income from the reversal of provisions.\n- () At . million, personnel expenses increased by . million compared to the previous year's figure of . million. This is partly due to the increase in the number of employees compared to and the expansion of the Executive Board. The company's remuneration system for members of governing bodies is set out in the remuneration report.\n- () Depreciation and amortisation on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets amounted to . million, which was at a level similar to the financial year.\n- () For its financial assets, Eckert & Ziegler AG calculated the enterprise value in each case using the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, which is based on current planning calculations over a five-year period. The company values determined as at December for all shares in affiliated companies were higher than the investment values recognised in the balance sheet. In the financial year, the company valuation for the investment in Eckert & Ziegler BEBIG GmbH resulted in a lower value than the carrying amount of the investment recognised up to that point. An impairment loss of . million was therefore recognised for this investment in the previous year.\n- () Other operating expenses increased by . million to . million compared to the previous year. The increase is mainly due to higher legal and consulting costs as well as services procured from third parties, which rose by a total of . million compared to .\n- () In the financial year, Eckert & Ziegler AG took over a profit of . million (previous year: . million) from its German subsidiary Eckert & Ziegler Radiopharma GmbH as part of the profit and loss transfer agreement. Eckert & Ziegler AG took over a loss of . million in the financial year (previous year: . million) from the profit and loss transfer agreement with Pentixapharm.\n\n{28}------------------------------------------------\n\n- () Eckert & Ziegler AG received a profit distribution from its subsidiaries Eckert & Ziegler Isotope Products Holdings GmbH totalling . million. This amounted to . million in the previous year. Eckert & Ziegler AG received a further . million (previous year: . million) in profit distributions in the financial year from a minority interest in a company.\n- () At –. million, total interest and similar expenses and other interest and similar income were –. million below the previous year's level of –. million.\n- () The sale of all shares in Myelo Therapeutics GmbH to the wholly owned subsidiary Pentixapharm AG in September generated income of . million for Eckert & Ziegler AG. Eckert & Ziegler AG realised income of . million from the sale of , shares in Pentixapharm AG (. of the share capital). There was no such income in the previous year.\n- () Despite the increase in earnings before taxes, income tax expenses fell by . million year-on-year to . million. The decline is mainly due to the fact that earnings before taxes in the financial year included . million income that was not recognised in the previous year.\n\nIn total for the financial year, an annual surplus of . million (previous year: . million) is reported, which is . million higher resulting from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries.\n\n### **Net assets and financial position of the company**\n\nThe balance sheet total of Eckert & Ziegler AG increased by . million to . million compared to the previous year. On the assets side, the increase in the balance sheet total is mainly reflected in the additions to shares in affiliated companies and receivables from affiliated companies. On the liabilities side, equity increased by . million and liabilities to affiliated companies by . million.\n\nThe following significant changes occurred in the financial year:\n\nInterests in affiliated companies rose sharply by . million, from . million to . million. In the financial year, . million was invested in capital reserve increases at the subsidiary Eckert & Ziegler Radiopharma GmbH and . million in capital increases at Pentixapharm AG, which used these funds for the acquisition of Myelo Therapeutics GmbH, among other things. This was offset by capital repayments of . million received from the subsidiary Eckert & Ziegler BEBIG GmbH, the sale of . of the shares in Pentixapharm AG totalling . million and the sale of Myelo Therapeutics GmbH to Pentixapharm AG amounting to . million.\n\nReceivables from affiliated companies increased by . million from . million in the previous year to . million. This was mainly due to the receivable resulting from the profit and loss transfer agreement with Eckert & Ziegler Radiopharma GmbH.\n\nBank balances amounted to . million as at December compared to . million as at December .\n\nEquity totalled . million, an increase of . million compared to the previous year. The increase is due to the net profit of . million generated in the financial year and . million from the use of treasury shares for employee remuneration. This was offset by an outflow of . million for the dividend distributed in the financial year.\n\nProvisions decreased by . million to . million. The reduction in provisions is mainly due to a . million decrease in tax provisions compared to the previous year.\n\nThe . million increase in liabilitiesfrom . million in the previous year to the current figure of . million is mainly due to the increase in liabilities to affiliated companies. On the one hand, liabilities to Pentixapharm AG from the assumption of losses under the profit and loss transfer agreement increased by . million; on the other hand, a credit line granted by Eckert & Ziegler Nuclitec GmbH in the amount of . million was utilised as at December .\n\nAs at December , the company had committed cash credit lines from banks in the amount of . million which were not utilised.\n\nOverall, the Executive Board continues to rate the company's economic position as very good. The equity ratio is (previous year: ).\n\n{29}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-29-0\"></span>**2.3 EMPLOYEES**\n\nAs at December , Eckert & Ziegler had a total of , employees across the Group (previous year: ). The number of employees thus increased by persons year-on-year. The increase is mainly attributable to the Medical and Other segments. In the Medical segment, the expansion of the workforce is a necessary step to meet the growing demand for radiopharmaceutical products. The majority of the increase in the Other segment is attributable to the ongoing expansion in the clinical development area. The discontinued operations accounted for a total of employees as at December (previous year: ).\n\nIf employee figures are calculated based on the definition set forth in the German Commercial Code (HGB), which relates to the average number of employees over the course of a year and excludes members of the Executive Board and managing directors, as well as trainees and interns, but includes part-time employees and employees with minimal working hours, the number of employees rose from to .\n\nEckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG had an average of employees, or more employees than in the previous year.\n\nAt , the turnover rate, defined as the number of employees who left the company during the year under review, was slightly above the previous year's level of , which is in line with the general trend and shows a slight increase in turnover to pre-crisis levels. However, this is still well below the average turnover rate in Germany, which was . in . The percentage of women in the total workforce stood at (previous year: ). At years of age, the average age in the financial year was on a par with the previous year, with a focus on the to age group. Slightly fewer than half of all employees have a degree from a university of applied sciences/bachelor's degree or a higher level of education.\n\nPersonnel expenses from continuing and discontinued operations totalled . million in the reporting period (previous year: . million). This translates into average personnel expenses of around . thousand per employee in , compared to around . thousand in the previous year.\n\nImage /page/29/Figure/7 description: The image contains two bar charts. The first bar chart is titled \"AVERAGE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES BY SEGMENT\". The x-axis shows the segment, and the y-axis shows the average number of employees. The segments are Isotope Products, Medical, and Others. For Isotope Products, the average number of employees in 2022 is 562, and in 2023 is 581. For Medical, the average number of employees in 2022 is 299, and in 2023 is 344. For Others, the average number of employees in 2022 is 85, and in 2023 is 110. The second bar chart is titled \"REVENUE PER EMPLOYEE IN € thousands\". The x-axis shows the segment, and the y-axis shows the revenue per employee in € thousands. The segments are Isotope Products, Medical, Others, and Group. For Isotope Products, the revenue per employee in 2022 is 234, and in 2023 is 225. For Medical, the revenue per employee in 2022 is 304, and in 2023 is 335. For Others, the revenue per employee in 2022 is 0, and in 2023 is 0. For Group, the revenue per employee in 2022 is 235, and in 2023 is 238.\n\nImage /page/29/Figure/8 description: The image is a bar chart titled \"NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES BY DEPARTMENT\". The x-axis represents different departments: Production, Development, Administration, Sales, and Quality management. The y-axis represents the number of employees, ranging from 0 to 550. The chart compares the number of employees in 2022 and 2023 for each department. In Production, there were 468 employees in 2022 and 514 in 2023. In Development, there were 80 employees in 2022 and 79 in 2023. In Administration, there were 192 employees in 2022 and 203 in 2023. In Sales, there were 137 employees in 2022 and 149 in 2023. In Quality management, there were 69 employees in 2022 and 90 in 2023.\n\n{30}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-30-0\"></span>Image /page/30/Figure/1 description: The image is a bar chart titled \"NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES BY REGION\". The x-axis shows the regions: Germany, EU (excluding Germany), USA, South America, and Others. The y-axis shows the number of employees, ranging from 0 to 650 in increments of 50. The bar chart compares the number of employees in 2022 and 2023 for each region. In Germany, the number of employees is 565 in 2022 and 630 in 2023. In EU (excluding Germany), the number of employees is 54 in 2022 and 56 in 2023. In USA, the number of employees is 151 in 2022 and 161 in 2023. In South America, the number of employees is 168 in 2022 and 180 in 2023. In Others, the number of employees is 8 in 2022 and 8 in 2023.\n\n# **2.4 OVERALL STATEMENT CONCERNING THE ECONOMIC POSITION**\n\nThe financial year was very successful. Eckert & Ziegler was able to increase revenue to a record level of over million. The demand for radiopharmaceutical products was again the largest growth driver across all segments. In addition, the Isotope Products segment was able to further strengthen its market position as a result of rising energy costs. Adjusted for one-off effects, earnings in the core business also continued to grow compared to the previous year. Overall, Eckert & Ziegler AG generated income of . per share from continuing operations. If discontinued operations are included, income is reduced to . per share.\n\nThe strong market positions of the respective segments are reflected in a solid balance sheet. The solid balance sheet ratios, such as the equity ratio, return on equity, debt repayment period and similar performance indicators, continue to provide the Group with financial latitude. The planned spin-off of Pentixapharm AG is intended to help the Eckert & Ziegler Group to pool its financial resources for the expansion of global manufacturing capacities in order to continue to meet the enormous growth forecast for active pharmaceutical ingredients. Eckert & Ziegler is concentrating on its core competences in order to further expand its position as a leading supplier of radioisotopes for the production of radiopharmaceuticals.\n\nOverall, the Executive Board is satisfied with the development of the operating business and the result achieved in .\n\n{31}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-31-0\"></span>**3. REPORT ON OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS**\n\nEckert & Ziegler AG's shareholders need to be aware that the Group as a whole is exposed to a wide range of opportunities and risks that may influence the company's business activities and share price. This report outlines the risks and opportunities and their potential impact on the Group as a whole. Furthermore, it describes the Group's risk management system and the safeguards it has put in place.\n\nThe group's opportunities and risks indirectly affect the parent company, Eckert & Ziegler AG, through its participations in other entities.\n\n### **3.1 ORGANISATION OF RISK MANAGEMENT**\n\nThe task of risk management is to systematically identify opportunities and risks and to assess them with respect to the effects they may have on the company. The term \"risk\" is therefore defined as variation from an expected value. According to this definition, both positive deviations (opportunities) and negative deviations (risks) are considered.\n\nThe overall responsibility for risk management lies with the Executive Board. However, operational responsibility – i.e., the early recognition, evaluation, management, and documentation of risks; the specification and implementation of suitable countermeasures; and the corresponding communication – lies primarily with the respective segment management and the management of the subsidiaries. This level below the Executive Board bears responsibility for risk management in its area. In addition to the annual structured risk assessment process, operational management is obliged to constantly monitor its area with regard to a changing risk situation. Fundamental changes to the specific risk situation for the area must be reported immediately to segment management and the Executive Board. Changes to risks with fundamental financial implications must also be reported to Group accounting.\n\nEckert & Ziegler's technical and managerial staff are consulted as part of the aforementioned annual process concerning structured risk analysis. They are asked to designate new and existing opportunities and risks and classify them according to the probability of occurrence and their potential impact on the company. Preventive measures are taken, contingency plans are drafted if applicable, and regular evaluations are organised for these risks to the extent possible.\n\nThese include monitoring the market and competitors, evaluating scientific literature, analysing customer complaints, and statistics on costs and revenue, among other things. The assessment of risks according to probability of occurrence and the potential extent of losses is reported to the Supervisory Board once a year.\n\nAs part of risk management, risks are classified into risks from the use of financial instruments, political risks, legal risks, IT risks, personnel risks, procurement risks, general risks arising from the production and handling of radioactivity, revenue market risks and strategic risks, risks from cost increases due to price hikes, main customer risks and research and development risks. The risk owners are identified. In a risk matrix, the identified risks are presented in terms of their likelihood of occurrence and their potential financial impact on the Group's net assets, financial position and financial performance in the categories very unlikely/unlikely/fairly unlikely/not very likely/fairly likely and very low/low/ medium/high/very high. Risks which jeopardise the company as a going concern are – where present – highlighted and reported separately. Risks are classified as follows:\n\n| Classification | Intensity             |\n|----------------|-----------------------|\n| 0 – Very low   | < 1 million euros     |\n| 1 – Low        | 1 to 2 million euros  |\n| 2 – Medium     | 2 to 5 million euros  |\n| 3 – High       | 5 to 20 million euros |\n| 4 – Very high  | > € 20 million        |\n\n| Classification      | Probability of occurrence within 24 months |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| 0 – Very unlikely   | < 0.01%                                    |\n| 1 – Unlikely        | 0.01% to < 0.5%                            |\n| 2 – Fairly unlikely | 0.5% to < 2%                               |\n| 3 – Not very likely | 2% to < 10%                                |\n| 4 – Fairly likely   | 10% to < 50%                               |\n\n{32}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-32-0\"></span>Overall, a risk-minimising approach is chosen. Existing risks are consistently monitored and are minimised or safeguarded against through ongoing process improvements. New product developments and acquisitions are checked for potential risks from the very start and are incorporated into the risk management system. Market developments are monitored, as are the activities of competitors, with the aim of being able to swiftly and promptly modify and implement the Group's own strategies.\n\nThe Supervisory Board – which is informed about and approves all key decisions, and which is regularly kept up to date on business developments – serves as an additional risk-protection element.\n\n# **3.2 FINANCIAL RISKS**\n\nThe avoidance of financial risks is monitored and managed by tools such as annual financial planning with adjustments during the year and careful analysis of deviations from the plan. This makes it possible to identify potential risks at an early stage and take appropriate countermeasures. In addition, derivative financial instruments are used to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates associated with operational business. Since hedges are entered into only for transactions whose volume exceeds certain thresholds, exchange rate fluctuations and changes in interest rates continue to have a certain impact on the Group's results.\n\n### **Liquidity risk**\n\nProbability of occurrence: **fairly unlikely**/intensity: **very high**\n\nThe Group believes that it currently has sufficient financial resources to ensure its continued existence as a going concern. Eckert & Ziegler's cash and cash equivalents totalled . million as at the reporting date. Net liquidity at the end of the year totalled €41.6 million<sup>1</sup>. The Group thus believes that it is in a position to meet all of its financial obligations.\n\nThe primary requirement for the ability to be able to refinance on favourable terms where necessary is the Group's good credit rating. This is confirmed by the credit terms offered. The Executive Board believes this is because of the Group's solid financing with a high equity ratio and the favourable prospects of the operating units. In addition to the high equity ratio, solid balance sheet ratios further underpin the Group's creditworthiness, as non-current assets are more than covered by equity and non-current liabilities.\n\n### **Risks from contingent liabilities**\n\nProbability of occurrence: **fairly unlikely**/intensity: **medium**\n\nGuarantees and sureties were provided for the benefit of subsidiaries. As at December , Eckert & Ziegler AG had committed guarantee lines in the amount of . million, of which . million had been drawn down for guarantees. However, no claims under the guarantees are expected.\n\n### **Exchange rate risks**\n\nProbability of occurrence: **fairly likely**/intensity: **medium**\n\nBecause it operates globally, the Group is exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates. Since the subsidiaries in the US, Brazil and Argentina generate the majority of the Group's revenue, the Group is positively or negative affected by changes in exchange rates in connection with the foreign currency translation (US dollar, Brazilian real and Argentine peso) of positions in the income statement. Through its global production network, the Group is in a position to offset most of the revenue generated in foreign currency against costs that are likewise incurred in foreign currency. Where required, the Group uses forward transactions and simple put options to hedge foreign currency revenue generated by German exports.\n\n### **Default risks for customer receivables**\n\nProbability of occurrence: **unlikely** (previous year: fairly unlikely)/intensity: **very low**\n\nThe Group is exposed to default risk on its trade receivables, in particular, in connection with its numerous foreign transactions.\n\nRisk exposure is primarily influenced by the size of the customers and the country-specific rules and opportunities for settling reimbursements of medical services by public providers.\n\nNew customers are assigned a credit score and first deliveries generally require advance payment. Deliveries to customers that are considered a permanent risk due to their size or location are secured by advance payment, sureties or letters of credit. Thus, high receivables are secured with documentary transactions.\n\n{33}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-33-0\"></span>The risk is monitored by means of regular past due analyses of all trade receivables. A functioning dunning management system has been established.\n\n### **Interest rate risk**\n\nProbability of occurrence: **not very likely**/intensity: **low**\n\nEckert & Ziegler has loan liabilities of . million as at December . Some of these are fixed-rate loans for which there is no interest rate risk. Others have to do with variable interest rate financing (-month Euribor) in connection with an interest rate cap.\n\nCommitted cash credit lines totalling . million are generally subject to interest rate risk. However, these were not utilised as at December .\n\nIn connection with testing the impairment of the carrying amounts of the participations in subsidiaries (impairment test), an increase in interest rates can result in a decline in fair values. If they fall below the carrying amount of the goodwill or the carrying amount of the interests in subsidiaries, this would create the need for a write-down at the consolidated level or in the separate financial statements of Eckert & Ziegler. This would have a negative impact on the net assets and financial performance of the Group or Eckert & Ziegler AG as a standalone company.\n\n### **3.3 POLITICAL RISKS**\n\n### **War in Ukraine**\n\nProbability of occurrence:**fairly likely**/intensity: **medium**\n\nThe military attack by Russia on Ukraine continues to adversely impact the global economy and the performance of companies. Eckert & Ziegler is primarily exposed on the procurement side. Sales to Russia are of minor significance in the Group. Economic sanctions are currently focused on exports to Russia and on the country's ability to access capital markets. As an importer, Eckert & Ziegler is not directly affected. Based on the sanctions, administrative procedures have been adjusted, and alternative transport routes have been established. So far, we have not been faced with insurmountable obstacles and continue to receive deliveries from Russia. Alternative suppliers outside of Russia are available for a number of radioisotopes.\n\n#### **Geopolitical tensions**\n\nProbability of occurrence: **not very likely**/intensity: **high**\n\nPersistent political tensions between other countries likewise harbour the latent risk of conflicts, with effects for the global economy and ensuing embargoes and supply difficulties. As a globally operating group, Eckert & Ziegler would be exposed to risk on the revenue side as well as the procurement side.\n\n### **3.4 LEGAL RISKS**\n\nProbability of occurrence:**fairly unlikely/intensity**: **medium**\n\nThe Group is exposed to legal risks arising from legal disputes or governmental or official proceedings in which it is currently involved or that may arise in the future. At this time, legal disputes or lawsuits that are not or not fully covered by insurance or provisions and that could have a significant adverse impact on consolidated net income are neither pending nor discernible, with the exception of the situation described below.\n\nA lawsuit is pending by individuals against the German state of Lower Saxony seeking a withdrawal of the company's licence to handle radioactive materials at the Braunschweig location, and the subsidiary concerned is involved in the proceedings as a joined party. If a final and binding judgement is entered ordering withdrawal of the licence, this would affect a substantial portion of the services provided at the Braunschweig location. Outsourcing to other locations would be partially but not fully possible.\n\nIn-court and out-of-court legal disputes are handled by in-house attorneys, who engage outside lawyers where necessary.\n\n{34}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-34-0\"></span>**3.5 IT RISKS**\n\nProbability of occurrence:**fairly likely**/intensity: **medium**\n\nEckert & Ziegler is exposed to the risk of IT system outages. In the event of loss/damage, this could result in loss of data and, in the worst-case scenario, business interruptions. There is also the risk of active hacking, phishing and malware. Protective measures include regular backups, antivirus software, firewalls, anti-malware software and the widespread use of virtualised servers.\n\n# **3.6 PERSONNEL RISKS**\n\nProbability of occurrence: **fairly likely**/intensity: **medium**\n\nIn many business divisions, Eckert & Ziegler depends on the specialised knowledge of its employees. The company depends on the knowledge and expertise of particularly highly qualified key individuals, especially when developing new business fields as well as in development and distribution. In order to minimise the risk of losing talented employees, the company strives to create a pleasant and supportive atmosphere, a modern and secure working environment, adequate remuneration, professional training and further education opportunities, and flexible working hours. Eckert & Ziegler is reliant on employees with specialist knowledge. In some cases, vacant positions cannot be filled immediately due to the lack of qualified personnel. Despite employee-friendly measures, Eckert & Ziegler cannot guarantee that these employees will remain with the company or display the necessary level of commitment.\n\n# **3.7 PROCUREMENT RISKS**\n\nProbability of occurrence: **not very likely**/intensity: **very high**\n\nThe risk of delivery bottlenecks and production downtime arises if it is not possible to source all raw materials and indirect materials at the required time and in the necessary quantities. The Group could lose key suppliers, suppliers could experience capacity bottlenecks, or political and organisational changes in the \"supplier\" countries could delay deliveries or make deliveries impossible. This risk can never be fully excluded. It can, however, be counteracted through warehousing and by establishing alternative sources of supply.\n\n### **3.8 GENERAL RISKS FROM THE PRODUCTION AND HANDLING OF RADIOACTIVITY**\n\nProbability of occurrence: **not very likely**/intensity: **high**\n\nBoth radioactivity itself and its use in medical or medicinal products involve product liability risks. Eckert & Ziegler addresses these risks by adhering to strict quality criteria. The majority of sites are ISO-certified, and the functioning of the quality management systems is regularly checked by internal and external audits. In order to avoid accidents that could injure employees, cause damage to the environment, or prompt regulatory agencies to close down production facilities, employees regularly undergo training on occupational safety and radiation protection. Despite all these measures, it cannot be ruled out that events giving rise to liability could nevertheless occur and pose a threat to the company. As far as it is possible and feasible, appropriate insurance has been taken out to guard against liability risks.\n\nEckert & Ziegler is dependent on specialised service providers to ship products worldwide that are often transported as hazardous goods. It cannot be guaranteed that these offers will be maintained in the existing form. Special official authorisation is necessary for the manufacturing and shipment of many products. Eckert & Ziegler is able to exert only indirect influence on the issuance or renewal of such authorisation. Given the rising threat of terror around the world, there is also the risk that the transportation of radioactive components will be more strictly regulated.\n\nThose who handle radioactive materials require a licence. This licence is issued by the competent authority in the relevant German federal state. The licence for handling radioactive materials is issued under Section of the German Radiation Protection Ordinance (StrlSchV). The licence is subject to compliance with extensive conditions listed in Section StrlSchV, and there is a risk that these will not be complied with. The application for a licence or amendment to a licence must be accompanied by appropriate documents to document compliance with the aforementioned requirements. The licence can be withdrawn if certain regulations, in particular, documentation regulations, are not complied with.\n\nEckert & Ziegler makes every effort to comply with all the relevant regulations and to implement any changes, orders and documentation requirements in a timely manner. Other authorisations, which are also mandatory for the business, are complied with and the relevant regulations and measures are introduced on time. While Eckert & Ziegler works closely with the approval authorities and also uses the help of local partners in regulatory matters, there is a risk that it may not be possible to implement certain requirements within the specified time limit. Eckert & Ziegler relies on options for the disposal of isotope technology waste, which is created when taking back sources or during production. A closure \n\n{35}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-35-0\"></span>or delayed opening of disposal facilities can lead to significant increases in costs. Efforts are made to reduce the impact of this risk to the greatest extent possible through internal recycling. However, this uncertainty cannot be completely eliminated.\n\nThere is also the risk that already classified radioactive waste may have to be disposed of differently than initially assumed due to new official regulations. This may result in the actual costs exceeding the values stated in the provision.\n\nThe handling of radioactive substances requires approval from the relevant government authorities. It cannot be ruled out that production or handling in individual cases or at certain locations may become more expensive, restricted or even prevented due to changes in legal or regulatory conditions.\n\n# **3.9 MARKET RISKS AND STRATEGIC RISKS**\n\nProbability of occurrence: **not very likely**/intensity: **medium**\n\nAs a specialist for a broad portfolio of isotope technology components, irradiation units, and radiopharmaceuticals, Eckert & Ziegler is better protected against slumps in the market than single-product companies. Although the various business segments are technologically close, they differ considerably in the product lifecycle as well as in the customer and market structures. This diversification generally reduces the risk that competitors will undermine the company's business foundation with new and better products. Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that improved processes and efforts by competitors might cause the loss of important markets, thereby jeopardising the company.\n\nTo counter this threat, Eckert & Ziegler actively seeks to develop new products and to identify and develop new business fields. However, there is the risk that such efforts will remain unsuccessful and that new business fields will be developed too late, inadequately, or not at all. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that competitors might have greater success with other products or market launch strategies.\n\nIn the medical divisions, the economic success of Eckert & Ziegler's products depends on cost reimbursement for the respective applications. A reduction or elimination of cost reimbursement would have dire consequences for revenue and earnings. Capital goods are also sold in the segments. In this regard, there is a risk of public and private customers being limited by budgetary constraints.\n\nStrategic risks relate to projects like geographic expansions or strategic participations. In addition to great opportunities, these projects also harbour risks. Failure to achieve the objectives associated with each of the projects could have an impact on the financial performance of the Group, but not directly on liquidity.\n\n# **3.10 RISKS POSED BY COST INCREASES DUE TO PRICE HIKES**\n\n### **Risk posed by cost increases in material procurement**\n\nProbability of occurrence: **fairly likely**/intensity: **low**\n\nThere is a general risk that suppliers will increase their list prices by – annually – or even more in times of high inflation – and this could have an adverse impact primarily on the gross profit margin. Price negotiations and strategic purchasing decisions (such as framework agreements, quantity discounts, etc.) can counteract these developments or improve predictability and provide cost certainty for a certain period of time.\n\n### **Risk posed by cost increases in the remediation of radioactive waste sites**\n\nProbability of occurrence: **fairly likely**/intensity: **medium**\n\nThere is a much higher risk from cost increases in the case of the current stockpiles of radioactive waste. As a result of political decisions and changes in legal requirements as well as government capacities, the costs of disposal may rise, for example, due to a reclassification of radioactive waste, bottlenecks in acceptance and thus time delays or higher acceptance costs as a result of changes to permanent disposal site conditions, which are passed on to the disposing companies. Therefore, the provisions created and calculated on the basis of the knowledge and assumptions available today may not be sufficient to cover the actual disposal costs. For this reason, the management of the companies concerned places the highest priority on the processing and timely disposal of these stockpiles of radioactive waste. Increased costs as a result of inflation, cost structure modifications and price increases expected in the future were sufficiently taken into account as at December in the calculation of the provision for the disposal of radioactive waste and for the decontamination of buildings and facilities, meaning that as things stand today, Eckert & Ziegler does not expect further, substantial unplanned cost increases.\n\n{36}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-36-0\"></span>**3.11 MAIN CUSTOMER RISK**\n\n### Probability of occurrence:**fairly unlikely**/intensity: **low**\n\nThere is a risk that main customers will reduce their purchase volumes individually or collectively. The lower demand from one of the main customers would have an adverse impact on the Group's financial performance. The Group's ten largest customers account for of operating revenue. This revenue performance is expected to be repeated in , as Eckert & Ziegler attaches importance to long-term arrangements or contracts.\n\n# **3.12 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RISKS**\n\nProbability of occurrence: **not very likely**/intensity: **very high**\n\nThe Eckert & Ziegler Group carries out its own research projects where possible. In this respect, Eckert & Ziegler focuses both on clinical development and on the enhancement of its own existing products. The aim is to strengthen its relative position in relation to competitors and alternative application methods. These measures may remain unsuccessful due to faster market developments or due to the wrong target orientation or even the non-achievement of development targets and subsequently lead to amortisation of intangible assets. Although this impact would be very high, it would not affect liquidity. An attempt is made to minimise the risks through market monitoring and project management-related measures.\n\n# **3.13 RISK DEVELOPMENT**\n\nFor the recognisable risks of the Eckert & Ziegler Group that could have a negative impact on the Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations, we have taken countermeasures and/or, if there is a corresponding probability of occurrence, balance sheet provisions as far as reasonable and possible.\n\nFollowing extensive analysis of the entire risk situation, no risks are currently discernible that could jeopardise the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, nor are any such risks foreseeable at this time, including in connection with other risks.\n\nThere were no major changes to risks compared with the previous year. The military attack by Russia on Ukraine continues to pose a challenge. Eckert & Ziegler has adjusted administrative procedures and established alternative transport routes. So far, we have not been faced with insurmountable obstacles and continue to receive deliveries from Russia. Based on the experiences in , we expect that we will remain able to procure raw materials and supply customers.\n\n# **3.14 OPPORTUNITY REPORT**\n\nThe momentum in M&A activity in recent years reflects the market's interest in decades of developments in radiopharmaceuticals. Precision oncology procedures enable patients to have more targeted tumour treatments, and they deliver higher success rates. Eckert & Ziegler is well equipped to take further advantage of this opportunity due to its established strong position in this niche market. Eckert & Ziegler remains one of the few suppliers of key precision oncology products such as Ge-/Ga- generators, yttrium- and lutetium-. Market growth remains unabated and will also continue in the coming years.\n\nSustainable growth is premised on the ongoing review and optimisation of existing processes and the product portfolio. The company is consolidating its competitive advantages by expanding its approvals and markets. The greatest challenge for the Group remains the identification of and expansion into new business areas aimed at strengthening both new and existing portfolios.\n\nTo this end, the Group is investing heavily in additional laboratories and production facilities for radioisotopes around the world. The acquisition of companies and/or participations also serves the purpose of opening up new business areas for the Group or making production processes more cost-efficient. An example of this is the joint venture agreement concluded in the financial year with Atom Mines LLC (Texas, USA). Eckert & Ziegler has co-financed the development of a new process for the production of ytterbium-, which is indispensable for the production of lutetium- , and will thus be exclusively able to use this high-purity ytterbium- for the production of lutetium- n.c.a. in pharmaceutical quality. Successfully completed development projects give rise to opportunities for disproportionate organic growth. Eckert & Ziegler also sees enormous opportunity in the emergence of new proprietary SPECT tracers. Demand for SPECT tracers is expected to increase dynamically and almost double over the next five years.\n\nOther successful development projects could lead to non-organic growth through new products in the portfolio and thus new business areas. Both would have a positive effect on market share and competitiveness and lead to a considerable increase in income. In this regard, one focus is on the development and manufacture of radionuclides that emit alpha \n\n{37}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-37-0\"></span>radiation (e.g. actinium-). In connection with this, Eckert & Ziegler and the Nuclear Physics Institute at the Czech Academy of Sciences, Ústav jaderné fyziky (UJF), agreed on a long-term collaboration for the manufacture of the alpha emitter actinium-. The agreement calls for Eckert & Ziegler to provide the UJF research centre with several million euros for investments in facilities and hot cells, as well as with radium- as starting material for testing and irradiation. In return, Eckert & Ziegler will receive exclusive access to the production capacities of a pilot plant under construction near Prague, as well as co-utilisation rights to process steps that are being developed for large-scale commercial Ac production. Experts anticipate that demand for actinium- in will increase exponentially in the next decade.\n\nIn addition, the boom in the radiopharmaceutical industry is also creating opportunities in the area of restoration and containment of contaminated sites. While they tend to be classified as a risk due to the growing red tape, this is not necessarily the case. If the management finds innovative solutions that can be used to reduce provisions, this could translate into considerable income. This assessment also applies to provisions for the dismantling of existing plants.\n\n# **3.15 ACCOUNTING-RELATED RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM**\n\nThe primary objective of the accounting-related internal control system is to reduce the risk of material misstatements in accounting, uncover materially inaccurate valuations and ensure that the laws and standards applicable to financial reporting are complied with.\n\nEckert & Ziegler AG prepares its annual financial statements in accordance with the accounting standards under commercial law, taking into account the supplementary provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS rules.\n\nAn accounting-related internal control system was implemented which corresponds to the size of the Group. The following presents organisational arrangements and measures of the accounting-related internal control system:\n\n- All units of the Group are integrated in a defined management and reporting structure. The applicable principles, structural and procedural organisation and defined processes are documented and are constantly adjusted to meet current developments.\n- The consolidated financial statements are prepared according to a schedule which is set centrally by the Group accounting department. The schedule defines all important activities and deadlines.\n- The Group accounting system is organised centrally. The involvement of external service providers in the closing process is generally limited to tax calculations for subsidiaries abroad. In a few exceptional cases, financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared externally.\n- The subsidiaries coordinate with the Group's headquarters on the accounting treatment of new matters. Changes to Group accounting are communicated directly to all employees and external service providers concerned.\n- The reporting of the subsidiaries is conducted using standardised forms which are completed by the respective accounting departments for the monthly, quarterly and annual financial statements.\n- The accounting information of all subsidiaries flows to the segments' controlling department, where it is monitored. Deviation analyses are carried out and discrepancies in terms of compliance with financial statement-relevant Group guidelines are examined and discussed with the respective subsidiary; if necessary, they are reported to the Group accounting department.\n- Initial internal reconciliation and consolidation is carried out at segment level in the central controlling department. This includes, among other things, a reconciliation of receivables and liabilities among the Group companies.\n- Monitoring in the area of consolidation arises from the consolidation process. Reconciliation discrepancies in consolidation are communicated to the respective subsidiaries and rectified.\n- The internal tax department is involved in calculating items relevant for the financial statements that include taxes.\n- Flat hierarchies, direct reporting channels and monthly interim financial statements make it possible to recognise and correct material accounting misstatements in accounting and significant misjudgements in good time.\n\nIrrespective of the specific design, it is not possible to achieve absolute certainty with respect to the meeting of the objectives of the accounting-related internal control system.\n\n{38}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-38-0\"></span>**4. FORECAST REPORT**\n\n# **4.1 COMPARISON WITH THE PREVIOUS YEAR**\n\nIn March , revenue of just under million was forecast for the financial year and a consolidated profit of around million. This forecast relates to the consolidated profit from \"continuing\" operations and operations now recognised as \"discontinued\". These targets were exceeded with revenue of . million and a consolidated profit of . million or . per share.\n\nAs the holding company, Eckert & Ziegler AG has forecast revenue of just over million and an operating loss before interest and taxes (EBIT) of just under million for . Due to dividend and profit transfer income of million and the offsetting takeover of anticipated losses of Pentixapharm AG in the amount of million, the forecast profit after taxes for the financial year should amount to around million. These budgeted figures were exceeded with revenue of million, an operating loss before interest and taxes (EBIT) of million, dividend and profit transfer income of million, income from the sale of shares totalling million and a net profit for the year of million.\n\nThe Isotope Products segment forecast revenue with external customers of around million and a net profit of just under million for . Both target figures were exceeded with revenue of . million and a net profit for the year of . million.\n\nThe Medical segment achieved revenue with external customers of . million, also exceeding the revenue forecast for of just under million. At . million, the planned net profit for the year of around million was narrowly missed due to unplanned financial expenses totalling . million (of which . million from currency losses).\n\nThe holding company and the discontinued operations of the clinical assets, consisting of Pentixapharm AG and its subsidiary Myelo Therapeutics GmbH, form the Other segment. A net loss for the year of around million was forecast for this segment. With a deficit of . million, the planned figure was slightly exceeded, due in particular to unplanned expenses in connection with the ongoing change of legal form to a European stock corporation (SE) and preparations for the spin-off of the clinical assets (. million).\n\n# **4.2 SITUATION AT THE BEGINNING OF 2024 AND FORECAST FOR THE YEAR**\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) is optimistic about the development of the global economy and, in its economic forecast for published at the end of January, assumes that economic growth in will be on a par with the previous year at .. Although global growth remains below the historical average compared to previous decades, the economies of several industrialised and emerging countries have proven to be significantly more resilient than initially assumed. The overall picture is likely to be better for many countries in than in the previous year. The IMF expects economic performance to develop positively in all countries analysed except Argentina. Inflation is falling faster than expected in most regions, as the problems on the supply side and the restrictive monetary policy have been overcome. Overall global inflation is expected to fall to . in . However, the challenge for policymakers remains successfully managing the final reduction in inflation to the target level.\n\nThe war in Ukraine and other global political tensions continue to pose risks. Eckert & Ziegler is primarily exposed on the procurement side. In the past financial year, Eckert & Ziegler has succeeded in importing Russian precursors without any major disruptions. The procurement from Russia of radioisotopes that are needed for production is functioning, as are transport and payment transactions. Alternative sources of supply have now been found for a large proportion of the raw materials required.\n\nTherefore, the following assessment is of course subject to the proviso that Eckert & Ziegler will not experience any further upheavals from the war in Ukraine or inflation. As important contributions to earnings and liquidity are generated by the Isotope Products segment, which is based in the USA, it also assumes that the weighted average exchange rate will be USD . per euro. At the time that the consolidated financial statements were prepared, the exchange rate stood at about USD ..\n\nFrom the financial year, \"EBIT before special items from continuing operations\" will be used as a key figure for the forecast instead of net profit for the year. Sales revenue is forecast to remain unchanged. Focussing on these two parameters provides a better assessment of the operating performance of the core business without special items, i.e. without effects that are special in terms of their nature and amount for the management of the Group. These include financial and currency results, losses in accordance with IAS (hyperinflation), acquisition costs, divestments and restructuring. When calculating this key figure, EBIT from continuing operations is increased by extraordinary expenses and reduced by extraordinary income.\n\n{39}------------------------------------------------\n\n<span id=\"page-39-0\"></span>The forecast report contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations regarding the future development of the company. The outlook is based on estimates made by management on the basis of all information available to it at the time this report was finalised. The statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are beyond the control of management. If the assumptions underlying the outlook are not correct or the risks or opportunities described materialise, the actual results and developments, both positive and negative, may deviate significantly from the statements made in the outlook. Eckert & Ziegler assumes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements contained in the management report outside the statutory disclosure requirements.\n\n# **4.3 FUTURE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT IN THE ISOTOPE PRODUCTS SEGMENT**\n\nThe Isotope Products segment is forecasting continued strong revenue in . Medical imaging specialist Tecnonuclear S.A. (Argentina) launched new diagnostic products in and expects them to be launched in selected South American markets in the second half of (subject to regulatory approval). Demand for non-Russian oil and gas continues to drive the exploration activities of energy companies and, as a result, the demand for metrological components. The segment has a very strong competitive position, it continues to develop new products and gain additional customers. With the commissioning of new nuclear power plants, the revenue of calibration and environmental monitoring products in the Analytics business division (USA) continue to rise. The Life Cycle Services division is well positioned to benefit from the decommissioning and refurbishment of ageing nuclear facilities. In addition, the sector in Europe is benefiting from growing pressure from regulatory authorities to dispose of unused radiation sources from medical and industrial users. The segment's two largest application areas – medical and industry – remain strong. Owing to the stable supply chain, the market share was expanded in these two mature markets, and the prospects for are positive. Sales with external customers are expected to amount to around million and EBIT before special items to around million.\n\n# **4.4 FUTURE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT IN THE MEDICAL SEGMENT**\n\nIn the Medical segment, it is becoming apparent that the demand of pharmaceutical companies for radiopharmaceutical products and services is growing unabated. Revenue in this area continues to rise in double-digit amounts. Interest remains high for qualified services in relation to development, the construction of production facilities and contract manufacturing. The announced market approvals of new products are expected to provide momentum for pharmaceutical radiodiagnostics, specifically the radionuclide generator GalliaPharm®. The increasing number of approved radiotherapeutic agents in clinical trials will stimulate demand for therapeutic isotopes. Eckert & Ziegler received GMP manufacturing authorisation for the therapeutic nuclide Lu- at its site in Braunschweig in and expects revenue to continue growing in . In view of the planned start of production of Ac- in the second half of , several supply contracts for this nuclide were concluded with pharmaceutical customers in the past year. The segment is therefore forecasting revenue with external customers of just under million in with EBIT before special items of around million.\n\n### **4.5 FUTURE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT IN THE OTHER SEGMENT**\n\nBecause of the strategic alignment of the Other segment, the Executive Board again expects that no external revenue will be generated in the financial year. The segment is forecasting EBIT before special items from continuing operations of around – million.\n\n### **4.6 FUTURE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT IN THE GROUP**\n\nBuilding on the above, the Executive Board hopes to build on the operating result of the financial year and achieve EBIT before special items from continuing operations of around million in . The associated expectation for revenue is nearly million. The forecast is conditioned on a weighted average exchange rate of USD . per euro and the assumption that Eckert & Ziegler will again not suffer any significant upheavals from the war in Ukraine.\n\n# **4.7 FUTURE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT OF ECKERT & ZIEGLER STRAHLEN- UND MEDIZINTECHNIK AG**\n\nFor , Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG expects to post revenue of around million. The forecast revenue is thus above the level of the previous year. In operational terms, EBIT before special items is expected to total – million. It will be offset by planned income of million from dividends and profit transfers.\n\n{40}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-40-0\"></span>**5. OTHER DISCLOSURES**\n\n# **5.1 EU TAXONOMY**\n\n### **5.1.1 EU taxonomy**\n\nThe aim of the EU taxonomy is promote investment flows from the financial sector to companies that are engaged in ecologically sustainable activities. It is intended to help the European Union implement the European Green Deal. In this regard, the objective is to reduce net emissions from greenhouse gases in the EU to zero by . Against this background, the EU Taxonomy Regulation went into force in mid-, which establishes a unified, legally binding classification system for determining which economic activities in the EU are considered environmentally sustainable. On the basis of the defined requirements, the EU-wide classification of economic activities is made with respect to their contribution to the following six environmental objectives:\n\n- () Climate change mitigation\n- () Climate change adaptation\n- () Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n- () Transition to a circular economy\n- () Pollution prevention and control\n- () Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nWith respect to the classification of an economic activity as \"environmentally sustainable\" within the meaning of the EU taxonomy, a distinction must be made between taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-compliant. As a first step, it must be examined whether an economic activity is described in the delegated act and thus is taxonomy-eligible. Only taxonomyeligible economic activities may be considered \"economically sustainable\" when they meet certain criteria. Then, in a second step, it must be evaluated whether the specified technical screening criteria are met in order to be classified as taxonomy-compliant.\n\nFor the year under review, the only business activities to be considered are those that contribute substantially to the two environmental objectives \"climate change mitigation\" and \"climate change adaptation\". The description of the economic activity in the delegated act establishes which economic activities may as a general rule be taken into consideration.\n\nAs a company that is obliged to submit a non-financial statement, Eckert & Ziegler is required under Article () of the Taxonomy Regulation to disclose information on how and to what extent our activities are linked to economic activities that are categorised as \"environmentally sustainable\" under EU taxonomy legislation. Furthermore, Eckert & Ziegler is obliged to report the indicators defined in the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\n### **5.1.2 Taxonomy-eligible economic activities**\n\nWe have compared our company activities with the activities defined in annexes and of the delegated act of June across all business divisions, including our Isotope Products, Medical and Other segments. None of Eckert & Ziegler's core business activities are classified as taxonomy-eligible. The analysis showed that no revenue-generating activity within the meaning of the EU taxonomy is undertaken at this time. With the economic activities currently covered by the taxonomy, the Technical Expert Group on Sustainable Finance (TEG) has prioritised the sectors that are responsible for . of all direct greenhouse gas emissions in the EU. The taxonomy thus covers the economic sectors of forestry, agriculture, production of goods/manufacturing, energy supply, water supply, sewage and waste disposal and the removal of environmental pollution, transport and storage, information and communication and construction. Eckert & Ziegler's business activities are not among these. Eckert & Ziegler produces only small quantities for its products and is, therefore, generally considered a low emitter of carbon dioxide. Above all, however, all energy-intensive raw materials are produced in a climate-neutral manner, since Eckert & Ziegler procures its output materials mainly from operators of nuclear reactors.\n\n### **5.1.3 Calculation of taxonomy indicators**\n\n### **Revenue**\n\nBy revenue, the EU taxonomy means net revenue from goods or services. The proportion of revenue derived from taxonomy-eligible economic activities (numerator) is then divided by the net revenue shown on the income statement (denominator).\n\n{41}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Capital expenditure**\n\nCapital Expenditure (CapEx) within the meaning of the EU taxonomy covers additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets during the financial year under consideration. This includes additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that result from company mergers. Eckert & Ziegler makes reference to the capital expenditure shown in the notes (denominator). Of this, the proportion of the taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure is to be specified (numerator). Data collection and the detailed analysis are handled by Controlling.\n\n### **Operating expenditure**\n\nOperating expenditure (OpEx) within the meaning of the EU taxonomy covers direct, non-capitalised costs that relate to research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leasing, maintenance and repair. Eckert & Ziegler makes reference to the expenditure for maintenance and repair, renovation, research and development, and costs for short-term leasing (denominator). Of this, the proportion of the taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure is to be specified (numerator). Data collection and the detailed analysis are handled by Controlling.\n\n### **5.1.4 Presentation of taxonomy indicators**\n\n{42}------------------------------------------------\n\n**41**\n\n| Financial year 01/01/- 31/12/2023                                                                                      |         | 2023                              | Criteria for a significant contribution |                           |                           |                                                              |                                  |                                  | DNSH criteria                                             |                           |                           |                                                              |                                  |                                  |                                                           |                    |                                           |                                |  |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--|\n| Economic activities                                                                                                    | Code(s) | Absolute revenue in €             | Share of revenue                        | Climate change mitigation | Climate change adaptation | Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources | Transition to a circular economy | Pollution prevention and control | Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems | Climate change mitigation | Climate change adaptation | Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources | Transition to a circular economy | Pollution prevention and control | Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems | Minimum protection | Taxonomy-compliant share of revenue, 2022 | Category (enabling activities) |  |\n| A.

Only then can we ensure the long-term success of the company. For further information, please refer to our sustainability report on our website at *www.ezag.com > Investors > Reports.*\n\n### **5.3 REMUNERATION REPORT**\n\nSection AktG now obliges listed companies to prepare a separate, joint remuneration report for the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. This must be published on the company's website for at least ten years.\n\nThe remuneration report is published separately and is available on our website at: *www.ezag.de > Investors > Corporate Governance.*\n\n### **5.4 INFORMATION REQUIRED UNDER TAKEOVER LAW**\n\nThe share capital of the company amounted to ,, on December (previous year: ,,) and is divided into ,, no-par value bearer shares. Each share represents one vote and is entitled to a share in profit. There are no shares with multiple, preferential or maximum voting rights.\n\nThere are no material agreements subject to a change of control as the result of a takeover bid. Furthermore, there are no agreements with members of the Executive Board or employees regarding compensation in the event of a takeover bid.\n\nThe Executive Board is not aware of any restrictions concerning voting rights or the transfer of shares.\n\nUnder the German Securities Trading Act (WpHG), every investor who reaches, exceeds or falls below certain amounts of voting rights in the company by way of acquisition, sale or any other action is required to notify the company and the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin). The lowest threshold for the disclosure of voting rights is . Direct or indirect participations in the capital of the company that exceed of the voting rights were disclosed to the company as follows:\n\nAs at December , the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Dr Andreas Eckert, held ,, shares indirectly through Eckert Wagniskapital und Frühphasenfinanzierung GmbH, Panketal, Germany, and shares directly, representing a total of . of the share capital of Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG of ,, shares. As at December , the total holdings of the remaining members of the Supervisory Board and members of the Executive Board and of shares issued by Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG amounted to less than of the share capital.\n\nShares with special rights that confer powers of control did not and do not exist.\n\nThe Executive Board manages the company and represents it in dealings with third parties. Section AktG governs the appointment and dismissal of members of the Executive Board. The Supervisory Board appoints the members of the Executive Board for a term of office of not more than five years. Repeat appointments or extensions of the term of office for a maximum of another five years are permissible. Such repeat appointments or extensions require another resolution by the Supervisory Board; this cannot be adopted earlier than one year prior to the expiry of the current term of office. The Supervisory Board can appoint a member of the Executive Board to the position of Chairman of the Executive Board. The Supervisory Board can revoke an appointment to the Executive Board and the appointment of a member of the Executive Board as Chairman of the Executive Board for good cause. Possible causes include serious breach of duty, the inability to properly manage business and a vote of no confidence by the Annual General Meeting.\n\nIn accordance with Article of the Company's Articles of Association, the Executive Board consists of one or more members. The Supervisory Board determines the number of members of the Executive Board.\n\nThe company's Articles of Association contain general provisions on the form of the company. Pursuant to Section AktG, any amendments to the company's Articles of Association are subject to the approval of the Annual General Meeting by at least a majority of three-quarters of the share capital represented at the time the resolution is adopted. The Supervisory Board is authorised to make amendments to the Articles of Association that relate only to version. It is furthermore authorised to amend the Articles of Association in the event that shares are issued up to the full amount of the Authorised Capital as well as after the end of the authorisation period for issuing shares up to the full amount of Authorised Capital.\n\nThe Executive Board was authorised, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to increase the company's share capital on one or more occasions on or before May by up to , by issuing new no-par-value bearer shares in exchange for cash contributions and/or contributions in kind (authorised capital). The new shares were generally to \n\n{46}------------------------------------------------\n\nbe offered to the shareholders for subscription; they could also be taken over by one or more banks or one or more equivalent institutions with the obligation to offer them to the shareholders for subscription.\n\nThe Executive Board could, with the approval of the Supervisory Board:\n\n- exclude shareholders' subscription rights up to an amount not exceeding of the share capital existing at the time of the exercise of this authorisation, in order to issue the new shares in exchange for cash contributions at an issue price that is not significantly lower than the market price of the company's shares of the same class that are already listed. Treasury shares of the company that were sold during the period of this authorisation under exclusion of shareholders' subscription rights in direct or analogous application of Section () sentence of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) were counted towards this limit. Furthermore, when calculating the limit, shares issued or to be issued during the period of this authorisation to service convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants were taken into account provided that the bonds were issued under exclusion of subscription rights in analogous application of Section () sentence AktG;\n- exclude shareholders' subscription rights for the purpose of acquiring contributions in kind, in particular, through the acquisition of companies or participations in companies or through the acquisition of other assets, including rights and claims, if the acquisition is in the company's best interest and should be completed in exchange for the issue of shares in company;\n- exclude shareholders' subscription rights to the extent necessary to grant holders of convertible bonds and/or bonds with warrants issued by the company or its subsidiaries a subscription right to new shares to the extent to which they are entitled after exercising their conversion or option rights;\n- exclude shareholders' subscription rights to offer the new shares to employees of the company or its affiliated undertakings in return for cash contributions;\n- exclude shareholders' subscription rights to compensate for fractional amounts.\n\nIn addition, the Executive Board is authorised, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, to specify further details pertaining to the capital increase and its implementation, particularly the substance of the rights attached to the shares and the other terms of the issue, including the issue price. The Supervisory Board is authorised to amend the Articles of Association after the capital increase is completed and, if the company does not issue shares up to the full amount of the Authorised Capital by May , after the end of the authorisation period.\n\nBy resolution of the Annual General Meeting on June , the Executive Board is authorised until June to acquire treasury shares up to a total of of the share capital existing at the time of the resolution or – if this is lower – when the authorisation is exercised. The shares acquired on the basis of this authorisation, together with other treasury shares held by the company or attributable to it pursuant to Sections d and e AktG, may not at any time account for more than of the respective share capital. The authorisation may be exercised in whole or in part, on one or more occasions, in pursuit of one or more purposes by the company or the Group companies, or by third parties on their behalf. The authorisation may not be used for the purpose of trading in treasury shares. At the discretion of the Executive Board, the shares may be acquired via the stock exchange or by means of a public purchase offer addressed to all shareholders or by means of a public invitation to submit such an offer.\n\n- If the shares are acquired via the stock exchange, the purchase price per share paid by the company (excluding ancillary acquisition costs) may not exceed the average closing price of the company's shares on the Exchange Electronic Trading (Xetra) electronic trading system (or a corresponding successor system) on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange by more than or fall below it by more than on the five trading days preceding the acquisition.\n- If the purchase is made on the basis of a public purchase offer or a public invitation to submit such an offer, the purchase price offered and paid for a share (excluding ancillary purchase costs) may be up to above or below the highest closing price of the company's share in the electronic trading system Exchange Electronic Trading (Xetra) (or a corresponding successor system) on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on the third trading day prior to the publication of the purchase offer. The acquisition offer or the public request to make such an offer may provide for other conditions. The acquisition offer may be modified if the trading price diverges significantly from the offered acquisition price or from the boundary values of any offered price range following publication of the acquisition offer or the public request to make such an offer. In such case, the cut-off date is the day on which the decision by Executive Board to adjust the offer or the request to make such an offer is published. In the case of a public acquisition offer, the company will make an offer to all shareholders in accordance with their shareholding ratio. The volume of the public acquisition offer may be limited. If the total subscription to the offer exceeds this volume, or in the case of a request to make such an offer, multiple offers are not all accepted, the acquisition takes place – under partial exclusion of any right to tender – in proportion to the tendered shares (tender ratios) instead of in proportion to the holding of the tendering shareholders (shareholding ratio). Similarly, in order to avoid fractional amounts, provision may be made for commercial rounding and preferred consideration of small quantities of up to shares for the purpose of acquiring tendered shares of the company per shareholder, under partial exclusion of any right of the shareholders to tender.\n\n{47}------------------------------------------------\n\n- <span id=\"page-47-0\"></span>• The Executive Board is authorised to use shares of the company acquired on the basis of this authorisation for all purposes permitted by law. In particular, the Executive Board may sell them through the stock exchange or an offer made to all shareholders. The uses include but are not limited to the following purposes:\n- The shares may be redeemed without the redemption or its implementation requiring another resolution of the Annual General Meeting. They may also be redeemed in a simplified procedure without a capital reduction by adjusting the proportionate arithmetical amount of the remaining no-par-value shares in the company's share capital. The cancellation may be limited to part of the acquired shares. The authorisation to redeem shares may be exercised multiple times. If the redemption is carried out using the simplified procedure, the Executive Board is authorised to amend the number of no-par-value shares in the Articles of Association.\n- The shares may also be sold in other ways than through the stock exchange or by an offer to all shareholders if the shares are sold for cash at a price that is not significantly below the arithmetic mean of the XETRA closing prices of the company's shares on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on the last five trading days preceding the sale. In this case, the number of shares to be sold that were issued in corresponding application of Section () sentence AktG (excluding subscription rights in exchange for cash contributions close to the market price) may not exceed of the share capital, either at the time the resolution is passed or at the time the authorisation is exercised. Shares issued or sold in direct or analogous application of Section () sentence AktG during the term of this authorisation up to this point in time are to be counted towards this limit. Shares issued during the term of this authorisation from authorised capital with the exclusion of subscription rights in accordance with Section () sentence AktG are also to be included.\n- The shares may be issued against contributions in kind, including in connection with the acquisition of companies, parts of companies or company participations and mergers of companies as well as the acquisition of other assets for the purpose of expanding business activities.\n- The shares may be issued to employees of the company and its affiliated companies and to members of the management of affiliated companies and used to service rights to acquire or obligations to acquire shares in the company granted to employees of the company and its affiliated companies and members of the management of affiliated companies, in particular in connection with share-based remuneration or participation programmes and share programmes. They may be offered, promised and transferred to such persons for consideration or free of charge, whereby the employment relationship must exist at the time of the offer or promise. The shares may also be granted to members of the Supervisory Board as part of the remuneration, to the extent legally permissible in individual cases.\n- Treasury shares may be used to fulfil obligations of the company arising from conversion rights or conversion obligations arising from convertible bonds issued by the company.\n\nAs at December , the company held , (previous year: ,) treasury shares with a nominal value of thousand (previous year: thousand), which are deducted from the outstanding capital in the balance sheet.\n\n# **5.5 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (SECTIONS289F AND 315D HGB)**\n\nThe company has issued a corporate governance statement, which is available on the website at *www.ezag.com > Investors > Corporate governance > Corporate governance statement*.\n\n# **5.6 REPORT ON RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATED COMPANIES**\n\nA report on relationships with affiliated companies was prepared containing the following declaration of the Executive Board:\n\n\"We declare that EZAG received appropriate consideration for each of the transactions listed in the report on relationships with affiliated companies under the circumstances known to us at the time that the transaction was entered into.

id=\"page-56-0\"></span>**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2023**\n\nThe Executive Board approved the consolidated financial statements for submission to the Supervisory Board on 91 March 4202. The Supervisory Board is responsible for reviewing and approving the consolidated financial state-ments. After publication, the financial statements can no longer be amended.\n\n# **FUNDAMENTALS, PRINCIPLES AND METHODS**\n\n### **1 | ORGANISATIONAND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS ACTIVITIES**\n\nIn the current 4202 financial year, Eckert & Ziegler AG \"Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG\" will change its legal form to a European stock corporation (SE) and will then operate under the name \"Eckert & Ziegler SE\". As this report relates to the 3202 financial year, the AG legal form is still used here.\n\nEckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG (hereinafter referred to as \"Eckert & Ziegler AG\") is a holding company with specialised subsidiaries worldwide engaged in the processing of radioisotopes and the development, production and sale of isotope technology components, radiopharmaceuticals and related products. The Group's products are primarily used in cancer therapy, nuclear medical imaging and industrial metrology. In these areas, Eckert & Ziegler AG and its subsidiaries directly address the needs of radiation therapists, radiation oncologists, and nuclear medicine spe-cialists, on the one hand, and, as manufacturer of precursors, those of companies that manufacture and sell radiophar-maceuticals, on the other.\n\nEckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG is a listed company under German law and parent company of the Eckert & Ziegler Group. It has its registered office at Robert-Rössle-Str. 52131 ,01 Berlin (Germany), and is registered in the commercial register of the local court of Berlin-Charlottenburg (Germany) under the registration number HRB 79946B.\n\n### **2 | ACCOUNTINGPRINCIPLES**\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Eckert & Ziegler AG as at 13 December 3202 were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The statements comply with all standards of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), London, to be applied in the EU on the reporting date, the relevant interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) and the Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC), as well as the pro-visions of the German Commercial Code (HGB), which apply in addition pursuant to Section 513e (1) HGB. The con-solidated financial statements present a true and accurate view of the Group's net assets, financial position and financial performance.\n\nThe reporting currency is the euro. The amounts shown in the consolidated financial statements are rounded to the nearest thousand euros.\n\nThe financial statements of the subsidiaries were prepared as at the reporting date for the consolidated financial statements, which corresponds to the reporting date for Eckert & Ziegler AG. The consolidated financial statements cover the reporting period from 1 January to 13 December 3202. The consolidated income statement was prepared in accord-ance with the cost-of-sale method. Other net income was presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements and combined management report prepared as at 13 December 3202 are published in the Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger). Eckert & Ziegler AG prepares the consolidated financial statements for the smallest and the largest group of companies.\n\nSince 1 January 0202, annual financial reports have been published in the uniform ESEF format – European Single Electronic Format.\n\n{57}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **3 | SIGNIFICANTACCOUNTING POLICIES**\n\n**Accounting policies** – Uniform accounting policies, which were also used for the comparative information of the previous year, are applied for the recognition of assets and liabilities of the domestic and foreign subsidiaries included by way of full consolidation. A subsidiary is a company that is controlled by Eckert & Ziegler AG: Control exists if Eckert & Ziegler is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.\n\n**Recognition** – The balance sheet is classified according to maturity. Assets and liabilities are recognised as current if they are due within one year or within one operating cycle or are held primarily for trading purposes. Accordingly, assets and liabilities are classified as non-current if they remain in the Group for longer than one year or longer than one operating cycle. Trade receivables and payables, contract assets and liabilities and inventories are generally recognised as current items. Deferred tax assets and -liabilities are recognised as non-current.\n\n**Measurement** – The consolidated financial statements are based on the principle of historical cost, with the exception of financial instruments, such as certain financial instruments, which are recognised at their fair value on the reporting date.\n\n**Estimation uncertainties** – When preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS, it is necessary to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount and presentation of recognised assets and liabilities and income and expenses. Significant assumptions and estimates are made for the useful lives (see Note , Note ), the recoverable amount of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (see Note ), the realisability of receivables (see Note ), the recognition and measurement of provisions (see Note ) and of financial instruments (see Note ), contract assets and liabilities (see Note ), the determination of the borrowing rate for leases (see Note ) as well as the realisability of deferred tax assets (see Note ). Estimation uncertainties also exist because of the restrictions introduced by Russia in July concerning the foreign repatriation of income from participations in Russian companies, as well as the increased risk of capital loss in the case of associates in Russia, the at-equity interests in associates domiciled in Russia were written down by . In addition, the assumptions and estimation uncertainties in the revenue recognised according to the stage of completion over a period of time for customer-specific production orders are in the range of the planned costs of the individual projects. The premises underlying these assumptions and estimates are based on the knowledge currently available at the given time. Actual amounts may differ from the originally expected estimates because conditions might develop differently than assumed. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in estimates are recognised prospectively.\n\n### **Discretionary decisions in applying accounting policies**\n\n- Non-current intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are recognised in the balance sheet at amortised cost. No use was made of the option to measure these assets at fair value.\n- Investments in which the Group has a significant influence despite holding less than , e.g. due to exclusive longterm supply contracts, are included in the Group as associates.\n\n**Goodwill** – Goodwill represents the difference between the total purchase price for a company or business operation and the fair value of the acquired net assets. Goodwill is not amortised. In accordance with IAS , it is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there is indication that the goodwill might be impaired, and where this is the case, it is written down to the recoverable amount. Impairment losses relating to goodwill are not reversed.\n\nOther **intangible assets** – Customer relationships, capitalised development costs, patents, technologies, restraints on competition, software, licences and similar rights are presented under other intangible assets.\n\n**Development costs** are capitalised as intangible assets if the requirements for capitalisation of internally generated intangible assets in accordance with IAS are cumulatively met, i.e. specifically if all of the following criteria are met:\n\n- Technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset\n- Intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it\n- Ability to use or sell the intangible asset\n- Existence of a market for or an internal use of the intangible asset\n- Availability of technical and financial resources to complete the development\n- Ability to reliably measure the expenditure attributable to the development\n\nCapitalised development costs consist of all directly attributable costs, which are incurred from the date when all capitalisation criteria have been met. After successful completion of the development project, capitalised development costs are amortised over the planned economic life of the product, and the amortisation of capitalised development costs is presented under cost of sales. According to IAS ., intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortised on a regular basis, but are subject to an annual impairment test in accordance with IAS .\n\n{58}------------------------------------------------\n\nResearch costs, along with development costs not eligible for capitalisation, are expensed as incurred.\n\nIntangible assets are capitalised at cost and, provided that these are intangible assets with finite useful lives, are amortised over their respective useful lives. Intangible assets are amortised over the following estimated useful lives:\n\n|                                    | Internally generated | Acquired against payment |\n|------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|\n| Customer relationships             | ─                    | 8 to 15 years            |\n| Capitalised development costs      | 3 to 10 years        | ─                        |\n| Patents, permits, trademarks, etc. | 6 to 20 years        | 10 years                 |\n| Other                              | 3 to 5 years         | 3 to 5 years             |\n\n**Property, plant and equipment** – Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of internally manufactured equipment and facilities includes all direct costs and allocated production overheads, as well as financing costs insofar as the requirements according to IAS are met. Administrative costs are capitalised only if there is a direct connection to manufacturing. Routine maintenance and repair costs are recognised immediately as an expense. Costs for the replacement of components or for overhauls of property, plant and equipment are capitalised if it is likely that the Group will derive the future economic benefit and the costs can be reliably calculated. Where depreciable property, plant and equipment consist of key identifiable components with different useful lives, such components are depreciated separately over the respective useful life (IAS components approach). If available, cost includes the estimated costs for the dismantling and removing the asset and restoring the site on which it is located. Internally manufactured facilities mainly relate to production lines. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis. The depreciation period is determined based on the estimated useful life. The following useful lives are assumed:\n\n| Buildings                      | 25 to 45 years     |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Leasehold improvements         | 10 to 15 years     |\n| Plant and machinery            | 4 to 10 years      |\n| Operating and office equipment | 3 to 13 years      |\n| Land                           | is not depreciated |\n\nWhen assets are scrapped or sold, the cost of the assets and the related accumulated depreciation and impairment losses are derecognised and any gains or losses from the disposal are recognised in profit and loss.\n\nA significant portion of the Group's depreciable assets is used to manufacture products. The Executive Board assesses the impairment of these assets by taking into account triggering events in the business environment. The Executive Board assumed that there was no impairment of usability as at December . However, the Executive Board's assessments regarding the ability to use and exploit the Group's depreciable assets may change, even in the short term, due to technological developments or changes in the regulatory environment.\n\n**Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment** – Impairment losses are recognised on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment if, due to certain events or changed circumstances, the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the recoverable amount of these assets. The recoverable amount is the fair value less costs to sell or value in use, whichever is higher. Acquired goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment at least once a year.\n\nAssets are written up if their recoverable value exceeds their book value. The asset is written up to at most the amount that would have existed if the previous impairment losses had not been recognised. Impaired goodwill is not written up.\n\nTo carry out the impairment test, the acquired goodwill is allocated to those *cash generating units* (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the company and business acquisitions. A cash generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows from continued use and is largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or other groups of assets. In the Isotope Products segment, the CGU corresponds to the segment as a whole, whereas in the Medical segment, four CGUs have been identified.\n\nThe Executive Board considers amounts that exceed of the Group's total goodwill to be material. This criterion is met by the CGU of the Isotope Products segment and by the Medical Devices business unit CGU of the Medical segment.\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment by calculating the value in use based on estimated future cash flows, which are derived from the medium-term projections for the individual segments. The medium-term planning horizon is five years. Cash flows beyond the detailed planning period are forecast by extrapolating the projections using a growth rate, which does not exceed the expected average market or industry growth.\n\nThe discount rates are calculated using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the respective CGU. There is uncertainty with respect to estimates used in the following assumptions used in the calculation:\n\n• Medium-term planning: Medium-term planning is based on past experience and takes into account market growth expectations specific to the business segment.\n\n{59}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Discount rates: The capitalisation interest rates were determined on the basis of the weighted average cost of capital customary in the industry.\n- Growth rates: The growth rates are based on published industry-related market research.\n\n**Inventories** – Inventories include raw materials and consumables, work in progress and finished goods and merchandise. Inventories are recognised at historical cost or net disposal value as at the reporting date, whichever is lower. In addition to direct costs, historical cost includes appropriate portions of the necessary material and production overheads as well as production-related depreciation and production-related administrative and social costs. Financing costs are not recognised as part of historical cost due to the short-term nature of the production process. Where necessary, the average cost method is applied in order to simplify the measurement.\n\nImpairment losses for obsolete or excess inventories are recognised based on an inventory analysis and future revenue forecasts.\n\n**Trade receivables** – A trade receivable is recognised when there is an unconditional right to consideration from the customer. After initial recognition, trade receivables are measured at amortised cost less impairment.\n\n**Cash and cash equivalents** – Cash and cash equivalents include bank balances, cash in hand and short-term deposits with remaining terms of three months or less from the date of acquisition, such as overnight money.\n\n**Pension provisions** – Pension obligations are measured on the basis of the *projected unit credit method* in accordance with IAS (Employee Benefits). Under the projected unit credit method, future salary and pension trends are taken into account in measuring the obligation. In order to standardise Group procedures, actuarial gains and losses have been recognised in other comprehensive income with no impact on profit or loss in consideration of deferred taxes and presented in full in the pension provisions since January .\n\n**Provisions** – Provisions are recognised only when a present obligation arises from past events. Provisions are recognised when it is more likely than not that an obligation has been incurred and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. The amounts recognised as provisions represent the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation as at the reporting date. Provisions with a maturity of more than months are discounted.\n\n**Provisions for restoration and disposal obligations** – Under IAS , the costs of dismantling and removing an item and restoring the site on which it is located are part of cost insofar as provisions for these costs have to be recognised in accordance with IAS .\n\nProvisions for restoration obligations are based on public-law and contractual obligations to decontaminate assets and buildings contaminated with radioactivity, to determine by measurement that they are free from contamination and to make them accessible and usable again without danger once the assets are removed from service. Accordingly, the cost estimate includes labour costs for dismantling the facilities, costs for processing waste to allow for it to be disposed, room cleaning costs, costs for inspections by experts and the costs for disposal of radioactive waste. Provisions with a maturity of more than months are discounted using an interest rate before taxes that reflects the risks pertaining to the debt. The accrued interest on the provision is recognised under interest expense.\n\nUnder IAS , provisions for restoration obligations are calculated in the amount needed to settle them. Provisions are recognised at the present value of the expenditures expected as at the reporting date. The calculation of the restoration obligations is based on various assumptions that reflect estimates. These include estimates of when the project will start, the number of working days required, daily rates and expected material costs. The amount of the provision allows for expected cost increases until the restoration work needs to be carried out. The amount of the obligation is reviewed as at each reporting date. In the event of changes to the amount, property, plant and equipment and provisions are adjusted accordingly.\n\nIn addition, radioactive waste arising from ongoing production and radioactive waste collected by third parties is included and measured at the expected cost of disposal or processing. Provisions are recognised at the present value of the expenditures expected as at the reporting date. The calculation of the disposal obligations is based on various assumptions that reflect estimates. This includes estimates of the reduction schedule, the number of working days required, daily rates and expected material costs. The amount of the provision allows for expected cost increases until the restoration work needs to be carried out. The amount of the obligation is reviewed as at each reporting date. These expenses are recognised under cost of sales.\n\n**Leasing** – A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The right to control the use of an identified asset is conveyed in many contracts, irrespective of their form, e.g. in rental, lease, and service contracts but also as part of outsourcing agreements. As a lessee, the Group recognises leases in accordance with the so-called right-of-use model (IFRS .), irrespective of the economic (ownership) relationships concerning the leased object upon lease commencement. Lessees can elect not to apply the right-of-use model to intangible assets, other than those already explicitly excluded from the scope of IFRS .\n\n{60}------------------------------------------------\n\nSignificant other options and practical expedients were exercised as follows:\n\n- Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are presented separately in the balance sheet.\n- In accordance with IFRS ., the Group elected to account for lease payments as an expense on a systematic basis for low-value leases (< ,) and short-term leases with a lease term of twelve months or less.\n- Where a contract provides for payments for lease components and non-lease components, the Group has elected, except for real estate leases, not to separate non-lease components from lease components in accordance with IFRS ..\n\nOn initial recognition, the lease liability is recognised at the present value of the future lease payments; subsequent measurement is at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Extension or cancellation options are taken into account when determining the term, provided these are exercised with sufficient certainty.\n\nLease liabilities include the following lease payments over the term of the lease:\n\n- Fixed payments\n- Extension and cancellation options of the lessee, provided it is reasonably certain that these options will be exercised in the future\n- Variable payments, if these depend on an index or interest rate\n- Expected residual value payments under residual value guarantees\n- The exercise price of a purchase option\n- Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if an option to terminate is exercised\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at historical cost, which comprises the following:\n\n- Lease liability\n- Initial direct costs\n- Restoration obligations\n\nRights of use are amortised on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their useful life and the expected term of the lease. Rights of use are recognised as part of the impairment test for property, plant and equipment carried out in accordance with IAS .\n\n**Financial instruments –** In accordance with IAS ., all contracts that give rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity are financial instruments.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are classified and recognised as follows in accordance with IFRS (see Note ):\n\n• **Financial assets** – Financial assets are classified into the measurement categories \"at amortised cost\" (AC), \"at fair value through other comprehensive income\" (FVTOCI) and \"at fair value through profit or loss\" (FVTPL).\n\nThe \"at amortised cost\" category includes all financial assets whose business model is linked to the objective of collecting the contractually agreed cash flows (\"hold\" business model). The contractual terms of the financial asset must also be structured in such a way that cash flows representing solely interest and amortisation occur at fixed points in time. In the Eckert & Ziegler Group, this includes in particular cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. The Group assesses the objectives of the business model in which the financial asset is held at the level of the overall company, how the company is managed and the information provided to management. Financial instruments classified at amortised cost are measured at fair value plus transaction costs at the time of acquisition using the effective interest method. Subsequent measurement is also based on the effective interest method, taking into account impairments and repayments. Interest income (using the effective interest method), foreign currency gains and losses and impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nMeasurement at fair value through other comprehensive income is to be applied to financial assets that have the objective of realising cash flows both by collecting the contractual payments and by selling them (\"hold and sell\" business model). The securities were part of the Eckert & Ziegler Group until they were sold in their entirety in .\n\nAll financial assets that are not classified as at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, i.e. financial assets classified as FVTPL, are measured at fair value through profit or loss at the time of acquisition and subsequently. The Eckert & Ziegler Group has financial assets categorised as \"at fair value through profit or loss\" in the form of freestanding derivatives (interest rate cap). In the case of financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs must be recognised directly in the income statement.\n\n{61}------------------------------------------------\n\n• **Financial liabilities –** Financial liabilities are classified in the categories \"at amortised cost\" (AC) and \"at fair value through profit or loss\" (FVTPL).\n\nFinancial liabilities in the \"at amortised cost\" category are mainly liabilities to banks and trade payables.\n\nThe Group measures financial liabilities at amortised cost. Additions are measured at fair value, which is amortised using the effective interest method or disposals made. All financial liabilities that are not categorised as AC are classified as at fair value through profit or loss and measured at fair value through profit or loss at the time of acquisition and in subsequent measurement.\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities were not reclassified after initial recognition. A regular way purchase or sale of financial assets is recognised or derecognised either on the trade date or the settlement date. The Group applies the trade date accounting method. The Eckert & Ziegler Group derecognises a financial asset when its contractual rights to receive cash flows from the financial asset expire, when it transfers its rights to receive contractual cash flows in a transaction or when substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the financial asset are transferred. The Eckert & Ziegler Group derecognises a financial liability when the contractual obligations are fulfilled, cancelled or expire. Financial assets and liabilities are only offset and their net amount recognised in the consolidated balance sheet if there is a legal right to do so and the intention is to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n**Measurement of financial assets and liabilities** – Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorised into the following levels of the fair value hierarchy accordance with IFRS :\n\n- **Level :** The fair value is determined on the basis of quoted, unadjusted prices on active markets for these assets and liabilities.\n- **Level :** The fair value of these assets and liabilities is determined based on parameters for which quoted prices, derived either directly or indirectly, are available on an active market.\n- **Level :** The fair value of these assets and liabilities is determined based on parameters for which no observable market data is available.\n\nSecurities (equity instruments of listed companies) belong to level of the measurement hierarchy.\n\nThe fair values of cash and cash equivalents, current receivables, trade payables, other current trade payables and other receivables essentially correspond to their carrying amounts. The primary reason for this is the short maturity of such instruments.\n\nDerivative financial instruments such as swaps or caps are used only for hedging purposes. They belong to level of the measurement hierarchy and are measured at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet, with changes in value recognised in profit or loss. Due to the high documentation requirements, the regulations on hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS are not utilised.\n\n**Revenue recognition** – Under IFRS , revenue is recognised when the control of goods or services is transferred to the customer. This means that the customer has the ability to direct the use of the transferred goods or services and obtain substantially all the remaining benefits. Revenue is recognised when there is an enforceable right to receive payment from the customer. Revenue corresponds to the contractually agreed transaction price.\n\nIf the agreed transaction price includes variable components, the \"expected value\" or a \"most likely amount\" method is used to calculate the amount of consideration.\n\nThe period between the transfer of goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer is one year or less. For this reason, no financing component is included in the transaction price. Where the contract has multiple identifiable performance obligations, the transaction price will be divided between the individual performance obligations based on the individual selling prices. As a rule, goods and services are sold at individual selling prices. The terms of payment usually provide for payment within days of invoicing.\n\n{62}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Group essentially generates the following revenue:\n\n- Revenue from the sale of goods: Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised at the time of delivery, because control is transferred to the customer at this point in time. Payment is due upon delivery.\n- Revenue from the provision of services: Revenue from the provision of services is recognised at a point in time when the contractually agreed service is performed. Where an invoice is issued, the right to payment arises after the provision of a service.\n- Revenue from customer-specific construction contracts: There are contracts with customers that regulate the provision of services over a certain period of time. In the case of these customer-specific contracts, advance payments and payments according to the progress of the project are generally agreed with the customer. The analysis of these contracts has shown that, in accordance with IFRS , revenue is recognised according to the progress of performance based on the ratio of the costs already incurred to the estimated total costs until the performance obligation has been met in full using the percentage of completion (POC) method. If one of the parties to the contract with the customer has fulfilled its contractual obligations, a contract asset, a contract liability or a receivable is recognised, depending on the relationship between the provision of services by the Group and payment by the customer. Contract assets and liabilities are recognised as current as they are incurred within the normal operating cycle. An expected loss from a contract is recognised immediately as an expense. In the percentage of completion method, the assessment of the degree of completion is of particular importance. The resulting material estimates include the estimated total costs, the total estimated revenue and the order risks. According to the percentage-of-completion method, changes in estimates can increase or decrease revenue.\n\nWarranties: As a rule, the company assumes warranty obligations only if required to do so by law or where such obligations are customary in the industry.\n\n**Advertising** – Advertising and other selling-related expenses are recognised through profit or loss when incurred.\n\n**Financial income and interest** – Interest is recognised as income or expense using the effective interest method. Interest payments are recognised in the cash outflow from financing activities. Dividend income is recognised in profit and loss at the time at which the Group's legal claim to payment arises.\n\n**Income taxes** – Income tax expense represents the sum of the current tax expense and deferred taxes. Current or deferred taxes are recognised in the consolidated income statement unless they relate to items recognised directly in equity in other comprehensive income. The current tax expense is determined on the basis of taxable income for the year. The Group's liability for current taxes is calculated based on the tax rates that are currently applicable or will be in the near future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in accordance with IAS in order to reflect the future tax effects arising from the temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated financial statements and the relevant amounts in the tax accounts. In addition, deferred tax assets are recognised as loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the statutory tax rates applicable to taxable income in the years when these temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effects of changes in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement in the financial year in which the changes to the law were adopted. Deferred tax assets are recognised only if it is likely that these assets will be recovered. Deferred taxes are measured using tax rates for future years, provided that they are specified by law or the legislative process has been essentially concluded. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if the relevant requirements of IAS are met. Under IAS , deferred taxes are classified as non-current assets or liabilities and are not discounted.\n\nCurrent income taxes are calculated based on the respective national taxable income for the year and national tax regulations.\n\n**Investment subsidies and other grants** – Grants are recognised in accordance with IAS . only if the company meets the conditions for obtaining the grant. Funds that the Group receives from public or private sources for investment or development projects are recognised as deferred income at the time of receipt. Grants for expenses are set off against the subsidised expenses in the financial year in which they are incurred. The deferred grants in the consolidated financial statements were granted for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, and for development costs. They are released through profit and loss over the useful life of the respective property, plant and equipment or intangible assets.\n\n**Earnings per share** – The profit or loss per share is calculated by dividing the consolidated net income attributable to shareholders of Eckert & Ziegler AG by the average number of shares outstanding during the financial year. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that would occur if all options to acquire ordinary shares were exercised at a price below the average share price for the period. It is calculated by dividing the portion of consolidated net income attributable to shareholders of Eckert & Ziegler by the sum of the average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year and the dilutive shares arising from the exercise of all outstanding options (calculated by applying the treasury stock method).\n\n{63}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Share-based remuneration** – For several years, the Group has had a remuneration plan in place that provides for compensation in shares. Under this plan, members of the Executive Board and selected employees receive a portion of their performance-based remuneration components in the form of shares. The expenses for equity-settled share-based payments for employees (treasury shares) are recognised at fair value on the grant/commitment date. This expense is recognised in personnel expenses over the period in which the service is rendered and, if applicable, the performance conditions are met (the vesting period). This share-based payment is recognised in accordance with IFRS with a corresponding increase in equity (retained earnings). The Group launched an employee share purchase programme (ESPP) on January to give employees a direct stake in the company's success. The share-based payment anchored in the ESPP is also recognised in equity in accordance with IFRS .\n\n**Segment reporting** – Pursuant to the so-called \"management approach\", the segment reporting of the Eckert & Ziegler Group is geared to the internal organisational and reporting structure. The Group has three segments: the Medical segment, Isotope Products segment and Other segment.\n\n**Currency translation** – Transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of a business unit are recognised in the functional currency at the mean spot exchange rate on the date of initial recognition. At the end of the reporting period, the company measures monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in the functional currency at the mean spot exchange rate applicable at that time. The company recognises gains and losses from these foreign currency measurements in the income statement. Non-monetary consolidated balance sheet items in foreign currencies are recognised at historical exchange rates.\n\n**Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies (IAS )** – The financial statement of an entity whose functional currency is the currency of a hyperinflationary economy are adjusted to account for the changes in the currency's purchasing power and restated. As part of the inflation adjustment, the non-monetary balance sheet items (including equity) and the profit and loss accounts are adjusted by the change in the index [Internal Wholesale Price Index (IPIM) published by the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INDEC)], since the date the assets were recognised up to the reporting date. By contrast. monetary items, such as liquid assets, trade receivables and trade payables, are not indexed, i.e. their carrying amounts do not change. The inflationary gain or loss in the reporting period is recognised in the income statement in the financial result. The adjustment to equity caused by inflation as well as currency translation differences are netted within cumulative other comprehensive income and recognised under \"Foreign currency translation differences\". In Argentina, prices in December , measured by the consumer price index, rose by . compared to the same month in the previous year. This means that the inflation rate in December was above for the eleventh month in a row.\n\n**Discontinued operations** – A part of the Eckert & Ziegler Group whose business activities and cash flows can be clearly distinguished operationally and for accounting purposes from the remaining business activities is recognised as a \"discontinued operation\" if it has either been sold or is classified as \"held for sale\". Discontinued operations are presented in a separate item in the consolidated income statement as the result of discontinued operations after taxes. If an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the consolidated income statement and the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the comparative year are adjusted as if the operation had been classified as such from the beginning of the comparative year.\n\n### **Changes in reporting compared to previous year**\n\n### **Recognition in the balance sheet of receivables from \"Percentage of completion\" under \"Contract assets\" or \"Contract liabilities\" instead of \"Inventories\" and \"Advance payments received\"**\n\nIn the financial year, POC receivables, i.e. the work performed by the Group in connection with customer-specific construction contracts, were netted with the advance payments received on an order-related basis for the first time. If the POC receivables are higher than the advance payments received, the balance is reported under \"Contract assets\" (, thousand as at December ). Conversely, if the advance payments received are higher than the POC receivable, the balance is reported under \"Contract liabilities\" (, thousand as at December ). The previous year's figures were adjusted accordingly. Until , the POC receivables (, thousand as at December ) were still reported under \"Inventories\" and the advance payments (, thousand as at December ) were reported unnetted under \"Advance payments received\".\n\n### **Recognition in the income statement of the loss in accordance with IAS (hyperinflation)**\n\nDue to the high inflation in Argentina, the Group applies IAS . The financial statements of Tecnonuclear SA, Argentina, whose functional currency is the Argentinian peso, are adjusted to the current purchasing power at the end of the reporting period. Transactions for all individual months of and non-monetary items are revalued at the end of the reporting period to reflect the current price index on the reporting date. In accordance with IAS , the monetary loss of , thousand has been recognised as a separate item in the income statement below the operating result in the financial result since the Annual Report. This results in a more reliable presentation of the Group's earnings position. The previous year's loss of , thousand was adjusted accordingly. In the annual financial statements, this item was still recognised under \"Other operating expenses\".\n\n{64}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **4 | NEWFINANCIAL REPORTING

standards will affect the Group's net assets, financial position and results of operations. The exact extent of the impact on the Group cannot yet be reliably determined. The Group intends to apply IFRS as of the mandatory date, provided that this has been recognised as part of the endorsement process.\n\n### **5 | CONSOLIDATION METHODS**\n\nThe Group usesthe acquisition method of accounting for capital consolidation in accordance with IFRS and IFRS . Initial consolidation takes place at the time of acquisition, i.e. when control over the acquired company is obtained. Control is obtained by the company when it can exercise the authority to make decisions concerning the company, is exposed to fluctuating yields from its participation and is able to influence the amount of yields based on its authority to make decisions. The acquired assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured at their fair values as at the acquisition date. The historical cost of the acquired interests is subsequently offset against the pro rata revalued equity of the subsidiary. Any resulting positive difference is reported as goodwill under intangible assets, while a negative difference is recognised immediately after review through profit or loss in the income statement.\n\nAll material assets and liabilities, income and expenses, and inter-company results between affiliated undertakings are eliminated in the course of consolidation. Joint ventures and associates are included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method. Profit or loss components attributable to non-controlling interests are reported separately in the net income for the period.\n\n{65}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe gain or loss and all elements of other consolidated net income are allocated to the shareholders of Eckert & Ziegler AG and the non-controlling interests. This is done even when it results in a negative balance for the non-controlling interests.\n\nInclusion in the consolidated financial statements ends when the company ceases to have control of the subsidiary. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of in the course of the year are included in the consolidated income statement and in other consolidated net income according to the date of acquisition or disposal.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are drawn up in euros, which is the Group's reporting currency. All amounts are listed in thousands of euros ( thousand), unless noted otherwise. In this regard, commercial rounding when adding amounts may result in insignificant rounding differences. The percentages shown are calculated on the basis of the respective amounts in thousands of euros. All included financial statements of the subsidiaries were prepared as at the reporting date for the annual financial statements of Eckert & Ziegler AG. Comparative figures for the previous year were calculated in accordance with the same principles.\n\n### **6 | SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION**\n\nThe subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements are:\n\n|                                                                            | Voting rights |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Eckert & Ziegler Isotope Products Holdings GmbH, Berlin                    | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Umweltdienste GmbH, Braunschweig *                        | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Environmental Services Ltd., Didcot, United Kingdom *     | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Nuclitec GmbH, Braunschweig *                             | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Isotope Products Inc., Valencia, USA *                    | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Analytics Inc., Atlanta, USA *                            | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Brasil Participações Ltda., São Paulo, Brazil *           | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Brasil Comercial Ltda., São Paulo, Brazil *               | 100%          |\n| Ambientis Radioproteção, São Paulo, Brazil*                                | 100%          |\n| Tecnonuclear SA, Buenos Aires, Argentina *                                 | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Isotope Products GmbH, Berlin *                           | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Isotope Products SARL, Les Ulis, France *                 | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Cesio s.r.o., Prague, Czech Republic *                    | 88.90%        |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Chemotrade GmbH, Düsseldorf *                             | 100%          |\n| Gamma-Service Recycling GmbH, Leipzig *                                    | 100%          |\n| Gamma-Service Medical GmbH, Leipzig *                                      | 100%          |\n| ISOTREND spol s.r.o., Prague, Czech Republic *                             | 100%          |\n| GBT Finanzen GmbH, Dresden *                                               | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Radiopharma GmbH, Berlin                                  | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Eurotope GmbH, Berlin *                                   | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Radiopharma Inc., Hopkinton, MA, USA *                    | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Radiopharma Projekte UG (limited liability), Berlin *     | 100%          |\n| Isotope Technologies Dresden GmbH, Dresden *                               | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler BEBIG GmbH, Berlin                                        | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler BEBIG SARL, Paris, France *                               | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler BEBIG Ltd., Didcot, Great Britain (liquidated) *          | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Iberia S.L.U., Madrid, Spain *                            | 100%          |\n| Eckert & Ziegler Portugal S.A.,Lisbon, Portugal (formerly Medwings S.A.) * | 100%          |\n| NRT Germany GmbH, Berlin *                                                 | 100%          |\n| Pentixapharm AG, Würzburg                                                  | 99.54%        |\n| Myelo Therapeutics GmbH, Berlin*                                           | 99.54%        |\n\n*\\* Indirect participation*\n\n{66}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **7 | CHANGES TO THE SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION**\n\nIn the financial year, the following company interests were acquired or sold and changes were made to the scope of consolidation (acquisitions are presented in Note ):\n\n- On November , Eckert & Ziegler signed a : joint venture agreement with the Chinese pharmaceutical company DongCheng Pharma (DC Pharma). DC Pharma acquired a million stake in the EZAG subsidiary Qi Kang Medical Technology (Changzhou) Co., Ltd. by way of a capital increase and holds of its shares as at December . Qi Kang Medical Technology is only accounted for using the at-equity method as at December . As the capital increase only took place at the end of the year, the profit and loss account of the subsidiary was still fully consolidated. Income of . million was recognised from the deconsolidation as at December .\n- Eckert & Ziegler BEBIG Ltd, Didcot, UK, was liquidated in December . The removal from the commercial register will not take place until . The company has not been active for a long time and was already dissolved last year.\n- As part of the preparations for the spin-off of the clinical assets (Pentixapharm AG and Myelo Therapeutics GmbH), , shares (.) in Pentixapharm AG were sold by Eckert & Ziegler AG on November . The profit and loss transfer agreement dated June concluded between Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG as the controlling company and Pentixapharm AG (following the conversion of Pentixapharm GmbH) was terminated by law with effect from December due to the participation of an outside shareholder in accordance with Section AktG. As a result, the Group now only owns . of Pentixapharm AG and its subsidiary Myelo Therapeutics GmbH.\n\n### **8 | INTERESTS IN JOINT VENTURES**\n\nA joint venture is based on a contractual agreement in which the Group and other contracting parties undertake a business venture under common leadership; this is the case if the strategic financial and business policies pursued in the joint venture require the consent of all parties. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. The consolidated income statement includes the Group's share of the income and expenses, as well as changes in the equity of participations measured at equity. If the Group's share in the loss of the joint venture exceeds the interest measured at equity, this interest is written down to zero. Further losses are not recognised unless the Group has a contractual obligation or has made payments to the benefit of the joint venture. Unrealised gains or losses from transactions by Group companies with the joint venture are eliminated against the carrying amount of the participation in the joint venture (maximum loss up to the carrying amount of the participation).\n\n### **9 | CURRENCY TRANSLATION**\n\nWith the exception of one company whose functional currency is the currency of a country with pronounced hyperinflation, the financial statements of the subsidiaries included in the Group, which are prepared in a foreign currency, are translated into euros in accordance with IAS . As the subsidiaries conduct their business affairs autonomously from a financial, economic and organisational standpoint, the functional currency of the consolidated companies corresponds to their respective national currency. Assets and liabilities are translated using the average exchange rate on the reporting date. Items in the income statement and the statement of cash flows are translated at the weighted average annual exchange rate. Equity components are translated at the historical rate when they were initially recognised. Resulting currency translation differences are recognised in a separate item in equity and under non-controlling interests without affecting profit or loss until the subsidiary is disposed of. Upon disposal of the subsidiary, all accumulated currency translation differences are reclassified to the consolidated income statement.\n\nWhen interests in a subsidiary are disposed of with no loss of control, the proportion of the currency translation differences applicable to the interests that are sold is allocated to the non-controlling interests effective on the date of disposal.\n\n{67}------------------------------------------------\n\n| Country | Currency | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 | Average exchange rate<br>2023 | Average exchange rate<br>2022 |\n|---------|----------|------------|------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| USA     | USD      | 1.11       | 1.07       | 1.09                          | 1.05                          |\n| CZ      | CZK      | 24.72      | 24.12      | 24.48                         | 24.57                         |\n| UK      | GBP      | 0.87       | 0.89       | 0.86                          | 0.85                          |\n| RU      | RUB      | 98.50      | 78.93      | 92.46                         | 75.66                         |\n| BR      | BRL      | 5.36       | 5.64       | 5.34                          | 5.44                          |\n| ARG     | ARS      | 893.90     | 189.69     |                               |                               |\n| CH      | CHF      | 0.93       | 0.98       | 0.94                          | 1.00                          |\n| CHN     | CNY      | 7.85       | 7.36       | 7.79                          | 7.08                          |\n\nThe following exchange rates were used for currency translation:\n\n### **10| DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS**\n\nA part of the EZAG Group whose business activities and cash flows can be clearly distinguished operationally and for accounting purposes from other business activities is recognised as a discontinued operation if it has either been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or represents a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.\n\nDiscontinued operations are not included in the profit/loss from continuing operations and are presented in a separate item in the consolidated income statement as profit/loss from discontinued operations after tax. If an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the consolidated income statement and the consolidated cash flow statement for the comparative year are adjusted as if the operation had been classified as such from the beginning of the comparative year\n\nIn October , the Supervisory Board of Eckert & Ziegler AG gave its approval to the Executive Board to prepare a spin-off of up to per cent of the shares in Pentixapharm AG. Pentixapharm AG and its subsidiary Myelo Therapeutics GmbH form the division that comprises the Group's clinical assets. The focus here is on the development of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. This division will be discontinued and the spin-off is being prepared. In accordance with the provisions of IFRS , the non-current and current assets and liabilities of Pentixapharm AG and Myelo Therapeutics GmbH are recognised as discontinued operations. In view of the enormous growth forecast for active pharmaceutical ingredients, Eckert & Ziegler intends to pool its financial resources to expand its global manufacturing capacities and concentrate on its core competences in order to further expand its position as a leading supplier of radioisotopes for the production of radiopharmaceuticals.\n\nDue to the upcoming spin-off of the division, the assets and liabilities will be classified as held for sale and reported separately in the balance sheet as at December . In accordance with IFRS , the division is presented as discontinued operations as at December . The expenses and income of this division are therefore recognised in \"Earnings after taxes from discontinued operations\". No impairment losses were recognised when classifying this division as held for sale. The assets and liabilities attributable to the division are reclassified to the \"Non-current assets held for sale\" and \"Liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale\" balance sheet items.\n\nThe previous year's figures in the income statement have been adjusted accordingly. However, the balance sheet as at December was not adjusted in accordance with the provisions of IFRS . The cash flow statement includes both continuing and discontinued operations.\n\nThe financial information on the discontinued operation is presented below.\n\nThe result and cash flow of the discontinued operation, which is included in the consolidated result, are as follows:\n\n| € thousand                          | 01/01/2023-<br>31/12/2023 | 01/01/2022-<br>31/12/2022- |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Revenue                             | 24                        | 31                         |\n| Other income                        | 1,737                     | -356                       |\n| Expenses                            | -7,085                    | -1,937                     |\n| Earnings before taxes               | -5,324                    | -2,262                     |\n| Attributable tax expense            | 1,611                     | 648                        |\n| Result from discontinued operations | -3,713                    | -1,614                     |\n\n{68}------------------------------------------------\n\nOf the result from discontinued operations, –, thousand (previous year: –, thousand) is attributable to the shareholders of Eckert & Ziegler AG.\n\n| € thousand                          | 01/01/2023–<br>31/12/2023 | 01/01/2022–<br>31/12/2022 |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Cash flow from operating activities | 2,197                     | -3,654                    |\n| Cash flow from investing activities | -4,940                    | -4,046                    |\n| Cash flow from financing activities | 11,358                    | 5,456                     |\n| Change in cash and cash equivalents | 8,615                     | -2,244                    |\n\nCash and cash equivalents totalled , thousand as at December .

The previous year's figures have been adjusted due to the recognition of Pentixapharm AG as a discontinued operation in .\n\n### **12 |REVENUE**\n\nThe Group generates itsrevenue from contracts with customers, primarily from the sale of goods and, to a lesser extent, from the provision of services and from construction contracts. Revenue from the sale of goods and the provision of services is recognised at a point in time, while revenue from construction contracts is recognised over time.\n\nIn the financial year, revenue increased from , thousand to , thousand and consisted of the following:\n\n| € thousand                              | 2023    | 2022    |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Revenue from the sale of goods          | 200,856 | 182,705 |\n| Revenue from the provision of services: | 31,245  | 32,970  |\n| Revenue from construction contracts     | 13,991  | 6,554   |\n| Total                                   | 246,092 | 222,229 |\n\nThe Group accounts for its revenue in compliance with IFRS \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\".\n\nIn the Medical segment, a comparatively small proportion of revenue in relation to the Group's total revenue is earned on the basis of multi-component contracts. In accordance with IFRS , these contracts are subjected to a detailed analysis. The projects in the Medical segment are mainly structured in such a way that all performance obligations of the company are priced separately in the contract at the regular individual selling price. The respective performance is also invoiced separately only after the company has met its obligations under the contract (i.e. delivered the product or provided the agreed service), and the revenue is recognised upon transfer of economic ownership.\n\nFor the projects in the plant engineering area, which are allocated to the Medical segment, contracts with customers generally address the provision of the service over a certain time frame in accordance with the progress of performance in relation to the complete fulfilment of the performance obligation.\n\nIn the and financial years, the Group generated revenue of , thousand (previous year: , thousand) from such contracts with customers.\n\n| € thousand     | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------|--------|--------|\n| Revenue        | 13,991

For foreign companies, the prevailing local tax rates were applied when calculating deferred taxes.\n\nDeferred taxes are based on the differences between the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements for assets and liabilities and the corresponding amounts included in the tax accounts of the respective individual Group companies. In addition, they apply to any tax loss carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities were offset in the balance sheet to the extent permitted under IAS .\n\nDeferred tax expenses of , thousand (previous year: , thousand) and deferred tax income of , thousand (previous year: , thousand) are attributable to the change in tax loss carryforwards in the year under review, while deferred tax income of , thousand (previous year: deferred tax expenses of , thousand). is attributable to temporary differences.\n\nIn total, , thousand (previous year: , thousand) deferred taxes on tax loss carryforwards were capitalised. The loss carryforwards mainly relate to loss carryforwards of the German companies of the Eckert & Ziegler Group totalling , thousand. The losses in Germany, the US and Brazil can be carried forward indefinitely. The loss carryforwards in Argentina ( thousand) and the Czech Republic ( thousand) are limited to years.\n\nOf a total of , thousand in deferred tax assets on loss carryforwards, , thousand (previous year: , thousand) are attributable to companies that still suffered a tax loss in but are expected to generate a profit in the future. In contrast to the previous year, loss carryforwards of thousand were used in the financial year, for which no deferred tax assets for loss carryforwards were recognised as at December of the previous year. As at December , the Group had loss carryforwards of , thousand (previous year: , thousand) for continuing operations for which no deferred tax assets were recognised, as it is unlikely that they can be used due to the uncertain earnings forecast or the planned discontinuation of operating activities in the future.\n\nCurrency translation resulted in changes in deferred taxes on temporary differences totalling thousand (previous year: thousand).\n\nIn the year under review, deferred tax income of thousand (previous year: – thousand) was recognised directly in equity in connection with actuarial gains and losses from the measurement of pension provisions.\n\nDeferred tax assets totalling , thousand were recognised in the consolidated balance sheet due to the presentation of business divisions held for sale (Pentixapharm AG and Myelo GmbH).\n\n{75}------------------------------------------------\n\nNo deferred tax liabilities were recognised for temporary differences from retained earnings of subsidiaries amounting to , thousand (previous year: , thousand) as Eckert & Ziegler AG is in a position to control the timing of the reversal and the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to individual items in the balance sheet are presented in the following table:\n\n|

|INTANGIBLEASSETS**\n\nThe changes in intangible assets from January to December are shown in the statement of changes in assets attached to the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIntangible assetsinclude goodwill, customer relationships, non-compete obligations, patents and technologies, licences and software, capitalised development costs and other intangible assets. As at December , no intangible assets were deposited or pledged as collateral.\n\na) Intangible assets not subject to scheduled amortisation \n\nThe intangible assets that are not subject to scheduled amortisation relate exclusively to the goodwill.\n\nThere were no additions of goodwill in the financial year. On whole, the items changed as follows:\n\n| € thousand                       | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| As at 1 January                  | 43,141 | 33,610 |\n| Additions                        | 0      | 9,089  |\n| Revaluation                      | -5,155 | 0      |\n| Spin-off                         | -775   | 0      |\n| Impairment loss                  | 0      | -474   |\n| Currency translation differences | -2,996 | -569   |\n| Compensation for inflation       | 1,508  | 1,485  |\n| As at 31 December                | 35,723 | 43,141 |\n\nThe reduction in goodwill totalling , thousand is due to the revaluation of Myelo Therapeutics GmbH in accordance with the final *purchase price allocation* (PPA). As part of the spin-off of the clinical assets, the final goodwill of thousand was reclassified to \"assets held for sale\". The currency effects are mainly due to the development of the Argentinian peso, which lost of its value against the euro in . As a significant portion of the goodwill is attributable to companies in the Isotope Products segment that prepare their accounts in US dollars, the slight change in the US dollar slightly increased the overall effect.\n\nSpecifically, goodwill is allocated to the segments and to the cash generating units as follows:\n\n|                                       | Goodwill | Goodwill |\n|---------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| € thousand                            | 2023     | 2022     |\n| Isotope Products segment              | 24,536   | 25,970   |\n| Medical segment                       | 11,187   | 11,240   |\n| thereof Medical Devices business unit | 8,395    | 8,395    |\n| thereof other segment business units  | 2,792    | 2,845    |\n| Other                                 | 0        | 5,931    |\n| As at 31 December                     | 35,723   | 43,141   |\n\nCapitalised goodwill was tested for impairment in accordance with IAS in the financial year. Goodwill was allocated to the relevant *cash generating units* (CGU). These represent the lowest level at which goodwill and assets are monitored for corporate management purposes. The Isotope Products segment constitutes a CGU. The Medical segment includes several business units (BUs), each of which constitutes a CGU.\n\nThe value in use of the cash generating units is derived from the discounted future cash flows that were determined based on the current five-year budgets. For the subsequent period, the cash flows were calculated using a growth rate of (previous year: ). The pre-tax discount rate was . for the Isotope Products segment and . for the CGUs in the Medical segment. The discount rate after taxes for the Isotope Products segment was . (previous year: .) and . for the CGUs of the Medical segment (previous year: .).\n\n{78}------------------------------------------------\n\nA need to recognise impairment losses was not identified as at December . Impairment testing as at December identified one need to recognise an impairment loss based on the respective recoverable amounts, namely thousand for the Medical Devices BU.\n\nThe outcome of impairment testing for the goodwill of the Isotope Products segment and the other Medical segment BUs (Pharma, Laboratory Equipment, Plant Engineering) was that there are no conceivable potential changes to key assumptions that could result in the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeding the recoverable amount.\n\nBecause the *headroom*, as the difference between the carrying amount of the CGU including goodwill and the recoverable amount, was low in the goodwill impairment test for the Medical Devices BU and because an impairment loss was recognised for this BU in the previous year, the results of the scenario analysis are presented here:\n\n- Scenario : If the discount rate after taxes is points higher (. instead of .), there is still no need to recognise an impairment loss.\n- Scenario : If the variable cost of sales were to increase by and at the same time the BU were to keep its prices constant and not take any measures to reduce fixed costs, an impairment loss of , thousand would be necessary.\n- Scenario : If revenue were lower than assumed but the relative margin remained the same and the BU did not take any measures to reduce fixed costs at the same time, an impairment loss of , thousand would be necessary.\n\t- b) Amortised intangible assets for the financial years ended December and , respectively, consisted of the following:\n\n()Acquired intangible assets\n\n|                                    | 2023<br>€ thousand | Remaining amortization<br>period | 2022<br>€ thousand |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Customer relationships             | 4,172              | 2–5 years                        | 6,439              |\n| Licenses/software/permits          | 8,285              | 1–5 years                        | 6,357              |\n| Patents/technology                 | 0                  |                                  | 4                  |\n| Development projects (in progress) | 0                  |                                  | 33,938             |\n| As at 31 December                  | 12,457             |                                  | 46,738             |\n\nThe difference between the purchase price of the interests in Pentixapharm AG (formerly Pentixapharm GmbH) and the carrying amounts recorded at the time of acquisition was recognised in as \"Acquired intangible assets\" under \"Development projects (in progress)\", since the acquired object was not a business within the meaning of IFRS . In connection with the final allocation of the purchase price for the acquisition of Myelo Therapeutics GmbH, , thousand was also recognised under the \"Development projects (in progress)\" item. At the end of , these development projects totalling , thousand were reclassified to the \"Assets held for sale\" balance sheet item due to the planned spin-off of the clinical assets.\n\n()Internally generated intangible assets\n\n|                                    | 2023<br>€ thousand | Remaining amortisation<br>period | 2022<br>€ thousand |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Software/approvals                 | 599                | 3–10 years                       | 647                |\n| Patents/technology                 | 0                  |                                  | 0                  |\n| Development projects (in progress) | 0                  |                                  | 6,480              |\n| As at 31 December                  | 599                |                                  | 7,127              |\n\nIntangible assets are amortised using the straight-line method. They are allocated in the income statement to cost of sales, selling expenses, general administrative costs and other operating expenses according to the functional area of the respective intangible assets (also see the remarks in Note ).\n\n### **27 |PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT**\n\nThe development of property, plant and equipmentfrom January to December is shown in the statement of changes in fixed assets attached to the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAdditions in the financial year mainly related to investments in land and buildings as well as production facilities for the purpose of building up new production capacities in America and Europe, the expansion and modernisation of existing production facilities, as well as ongoing replacement investments. In the financial year, self-constructed production facilities totalling , thousand (previous year: , thousand) were capitalised.\n\nAs at December , no property, plant and equipment or real estate had been deposited or pledged as collateral.\n\n{79}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **28 | LEASING**\n\nThe Group leases various office, warehouse and production buildings and related outdoor facilities and vehicles. The Group concludes leases that have fixed terms with renewal options and that have indefinite terms with specified termination notice periods or revolving renewal options after the expiry of the minimum term. In all of these cases, the Eckert & Ziegler Group specifies the lease term where it is reasonably certain that it will exercise the renewal option or not exercise the termination option.\n\nThe specification of the lease term constitutes a critical estimate. The Executive Board considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise a renewal option or not exercise a termination option. In particular, it takes into account the fact that the production programmes and the work with radioactive material make it necessary to stay in one location for an extended period of time. Against this background, the exercise of the renewal option or the non-exercise of the termination option has tended to be classified as reasonably certain if the exercise or non-exercise of these options is dependent on the decisions of the Group and there are no other facts and circumstances to the contrary.\n\nThe balance sheet shows the following amounts relating to leases:\n\n| € thousand          | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n|---------------------|------------|------------|\n| Right-of-use assets |            |            |\n| Land and buildings  | 28,176     | 25,277     |\n| Outdoor facilities  | 95         | 341        |\n| Vehicles            | 657        | 877        |\n|                     | 28,928     | 26,495     |\n| Lease liabilities   |            |            |\n| Short-term          | 2,596      | 2,690      |\n| Long-term           | 27,320     | 24,497     |\n|                     | 29,916     | 27,187     |\n\nThe income statement shows the following amounts relating to leases:\n\n| € thousand                                                   | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Depreciation of right-of-use assets                          |            |            |\n| Buildings                                                    | 2,624      | 2,553      |\n| Outdoor facilities                                           | 48         | 42         |\n| Vehicles                                                     | 388        | 383        |\n| Total (see also Note 17)                                     | 3,060      | 2,978      |\n| Interest expenses (see also Note 22)                         | 840        | 618        |\n| Expenses not include in the measurement of lease liabilities |            |            |\n| For short-term leases                                        | 234        | 200        |\n| For leases for low-value assets                              | 165        | 151        |\n\nIn , lease liabilities gave rise to payments of , thousand (: , thousand), of which , thousand (: , thousand) was for the principal portion and thousand (: thousand) was for the interest portion.\n\nThe following outflows are expected in subsequent years from recognised leases (undiscounted amounts):\n\n| € thousand                                       | 31/12/2023 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Due within one year                              | 3,561      |\n| Due later than one year but less than five years | 12,899     |\n| Due later than five years                        | 20,145     |\n| Total (undiscounted)                             | 36,605     |\n\n### **29|OTHERNON-CURRENT ASSETS**\n\nOther non-current assets are financial assets, which mainly comprise the asset value of various reinsurance policies totalling thousand (previous year: thousand) and security deposits paid in the amount of thousand (previous year: thousand).\n\nTo hedge the interest rate risk associated with a . million loan over five years with a variable interest rate based on the -month Euribor, the Group concluded an interest rate cap with Deutsche Bank AG on May . As with the loan, this interest rate cap has a nominal value of million, a duration of five years, and a similar repayment structure. The strike takes place when the -month Euribor reaches .. However, since the terms of the interest rate cap are only partially consistent with those of the loan, the cap is not accounted for as a hedge. The fair value of the interest rate cap was recognised under \"Other non-current assets\" at thousand (previous year: thousand).\n\n{80}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **30| INTERESTS IN ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES**\n\nThe Group's participations measured at equity consisted of participations in the following associates:\n\n- ZAO NanoBrachyTech, Dubna, Russia\n- Nuclear Control & Consulting GmbH, Leipzig\n- ZAO Ritverc, St. Petersburg, Russia\n- Atom Mines LLC, Austin Texas, USA\n- BEBIG Medical GmbH, Berlin\n- Qi Kang Medical Technology Co. Ltd, Changzhou, China\n\nThe reported carrying amount totalling , thousand (previous year: , thousand is distributed as follows:\n\n|                                   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| ZAO NanoBrachyTech                | 549    | 829    |\n| Nuclear Control & Consulting GmbH | 248    | 209    |\n| ZAO Ritverc                       | 1,595  | 1,451  |\n| Atom Mines LLC                    | 479    | 703    |\n| BEBIG Medical GmbH                | 10,780 | 10,780 |\n| Qi Kang Medical                   | 18,460 | 0      |\n\nSince , Eckert & Ziegler BEBIG GmbH has held of the interests in Russia-based ZAO NanoBrachyTech (NBT), which in turn wholly owns OOO BEBIG, Moscow/Russia. OOO BEBIG is supplied by Eckert & Ziegler BEBIG GmbH (see also the remarks in Note ). Apart from the participation in OOO BEBIG, NBT is not engaged in any other significant business activities. Eckert & Ziegler BEBIG GmbH exercises significant influence over ZAO NanoBrachyTech both through its voting rights and through its supplying of OOO BEBIG, and it accounts for this participation as an associate. Because of the restrictions introduced by Russia in July concerning the foreign repatriation of income from participations in Russian companies, as well as the increased risk of capital loss in the case of associates in Russia, the at-equity interests in associates domiciled in Russia were written down by . Dividends received in the financial year in the amount of thousand were recognised directly in equity.\n\nNuclear Control & Consulting GmbH has been a service provider and expert organisation for radiation protection tasks since . The stake has been part of the Group since the acquisition of the Gamma-Service Group in .\n\nEckert & Ziegler BEBIG GmbH holds of the shares in ZAO Ritverc, St. Petersburg, Russia. Similar to NBT, the investment is valued at a discount of . Dividends received in the financial year in the amount of thousand were recognised directly in equity.\n\nOn January , Eckert & Ziegler Radiopharma GmbH acquired . of the interests in Atom Mines LLC, Texas, USA, Atom Mines LLC is a manufacturer of ytterbium. Eckert & Ziegler Radiopharma GmbH has concluded an exclusive, long-term contract with it for the supply of ytterbium-. As a result, the Group has a significant influence on Atom Mines LLC; this explains why the company is consolidated using the at-equity method (IFRS .) despite a shareholding of less than . In , the company posted a loss of thousand.\n\nWith effect from March , Eckert & Ziegler BEBIG GmbH disposed of its HDR business, which it had previously spun off to BEBIG Medical GmbH. In this respect, it sold of the interests in BEBIG Medical GmbH to TCL Healthcare Equipment, Shanghai. The stake in BEBIG Medical GmbH remaining in the Group has since been consolidated at-equity in the Eckert & Ziegler Group. At the end of , the provisional profit of BEBIG Medical GmbH amounted to , thousand (previous year: , thousand).\n\nThe following tables provide an overview of the summarised financial information with respect to significant participations measured at-equity:\n\n#### **Joint venture Qi Kang Medical Technology Co., Ltd.

Where these have been assigned to employees, the reinsurance policies are reported as plan assets netted against the pension provisions. Claims under reinsurance policies that have not been assigned are reported as non-current assets.\n\nThe type and amount of benefits payable under the pension plans are specified in company agreements (pension schemes). Essentially, these are either old-age pensions or one-off payments, which are paid to employees by the employer after they have left the company and reached the specified age limit.\n\nThe Group's pension plans are exposed to risks from changes in actuarial assumptions, such as actuarial interest rates, salary and pension trends, and longevity risk. A lower discount rate leads to higher pension obligations. Similarly, lower than expected performance of the plan assets could lead to a deterioration in the funded status.\n\nThere were no significant changes to these defined benefit plans in the and .\n\nIn accordance with IAS (revised), pension obligations were calculated using the projected unit credit (PUC) method and recognised at the present value of the pension entitlements earned on the measurement date, including expected future pension and salary increases. The actuarial measurement of the plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation was performed as at December by Longial AG and Allianz Lebensversicherung AG, respectively (as in the previous year).\n\n{87}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe most important assumptions underlying the actuarial measurement were:\n\n| %                                     | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2022   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Discount rate(s)                      | 3.25         | 3.55 to 3.70 |\n| Expected return on plan assets        | 3.25         | 1.00         |\n| Expected percentage salary increases  | 0.00 to 3.00 | 0.00 to 2.50 |\n| Expected percentage pension increases | 0.00 to 2.40 | 0.00 to 2.40 |\n| Turnover rate                         | 0.00 to 2.00 | 0.00 to 2.00 |\n\nAs at December of the respective financial year, the following amounts were calculated using actuarial methods:\n\n| € thousand                                           | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Present value of defined benefit pension obligations | 11,126 | 10,433 |\n| Plan assets measured at fair value                   | -163   | -162   |\n| Pension provisions as at 31 December                 | 10,963 | 10,271 |\n\nThe amount recognised for pension provisions changed as follows:\n\n| € thousand                           | 2023   | 2022     |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|----------|\n| Pension provisions as at 1 January   | 10,271 | 13,044   |\n| Expenses for pension obligations     | 497    | 338      |\n| Actuarial gains (–)/losses (+) *     | 560    | $-2,761$ |\n| Disbursements from plan assets       | 4      | 4        |\n| Income from plan assets              | $-6$   | –2       |\n| Pension payments                     | –363   | –352     |\n| Pension provisions as at 31 December | 10,963 | 10,271   |\n\n\\* before deferred taxes\n\nOf the actuarial gains (–)/losses (+), thousand (previous year: –, thousand) resulted from changes in financial assumptions and – thousand (previous year: + thousand) from adjustments based on experience.

The adjusted interest rates are between . and . (previous year: . and .). If the previous year's interest rates of . to . had been maintained, the provision would have been , thousand lower (previous year: , thousand higher). Payments for restoration are expected in the to financial years.\n\nOther non-current provisions as at December mainly relate to provisions for the obligation to process own radioactive waste and radioactive waste accepted from third parties as well as take-back obligations for sold radiation sources in the amount of , thousand (previous year: , thousand). These provisions are created based on the anticipated internal and external costs of processing, which are regularly reviewed and updated. Cost calculation is based on empirical values and past costs for disposal. The extrapolation of historical costs into the future involves estimation uncertainties, in particular due to\n\n- uncertainty relating to future measurements of underlying disposal channels, the degree of usability and related external costs.\n- inability to take into account potential amendments in legal and/or regulatory requirements affecting both internal expenses as well as external disposal costs.\n- valuation risks due to the use of flat-rate price increases and fixed discount rates.\n\n{89}------------------------------------------------\n\nOther non-current provisions also include , thousand (previous year: , thousand) for long-term services still to be rendered for the fulfilment of various contracts, thousand in provisions for impending losses from pending transactions (previous year: thousand), personnel-related provisions (from long-service anniversaries and long-term bonuses) of thousand (previous year: thousand), provisions for clearance measurement and restoration in the amount of thousand (previous year: thousand) and archiving provisions in the amount of thousand (previous year: thousand).\n\nOther non-current provisions developed as follows in the and financial years:\n\n| € thousand                   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Provisions as at 1 January   | 28,855 | 28,887 |\n| Additions                    | 6,395  | 4,398  |\n| Disposals                    | 59     | -745   |\n| Compounding                  | 566    | 5      |\n| Utilisation                  | -3,667 | -3,690 |\n| Currency translation         | 0      | 0      |\n| Provisions as at 31 December | 32,208 | 28,855 |\n\nOther current provisions totalling , thousand (previous year: , thousand) mainly relate to the current portion of radioactive waste requiring disposal.\n\n### **41 |OTHERNON-CURRENT LIABILITIES**\n\nOther non-currentliabilities decreased year-on-year from , thousand to , thousand. The liabilities remaining as at December mainly relate to non-current liabilities from the acquisition of shares in Tecnonuclear SA, Argentina, to former shareholders in the amount of , thousand. The non-current liability from the acquisition of Myelo Therapeutics GmbH (, thousand) as at December is now recognised at a value of , thousand due to the final PPA under the \"Liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale\" item.\n\n### **42 |ADVANCEPAYMENTS RECEIVED**\n\nIn connection with contracts with customers, the Group companies receive advance payments that are recognised as current liabilities. The advance payments received of , thousand reported as at December were largely realised as revenue in the financial year. As at December , , thousand was reported as advance payments received. The advance payments of , thousand in connection with the plant engineering area as at December are included in the \"Contract assets\" and \"Contract liabilities\" items.\n\n### **43|OTHERCURRENT LIABILITIES**\n\nOther current liabilities breaks down as follows as at December :\n\n| € thousand                                                                         | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Liabilities from wages and salaries as well as other personnel-related liabilities | 10,444 | 10,039 |\n| Liabilities related to social security                                             | 839    | 774    |\n| Liabilities to tax authorities                                                     | 607    | 1,165  |\n| Liabilities from outstanding invoices and other accrued expenses                   | 8,525  | 7,737  |\n| Liabilities to at-equity shareholders                                              | 1,408  | 1,408  |\n| Other liabilities                                                                  | 2,060  | 6,375  |\n| As at 31 December                                                                  | 23,883 | 27,498 |\n\nThis includes , thousand (previous year: , thousand) as financial liabilities.

As at December , the fair value of the derivative asset (measurement hierarchy level ) from the interest rate cap was thousand (previous year: thousand). The fair value of the interest rate cap was determined using a standard market interest rate option valuation model, taking market parameters into account.\n\nFinancial liabilities measured at fair value included the following items:\n\n• Liabilities from contingent purchase price payments from company acquisitions within the meaning of IFRS in the amount of , thousand as at December . The fair value of these liabilities is determined on the basis of the agreed conditions for variable purchase price determination and taking into account the estimated probability of occurrence of these conditions (measurement hierarchy level ).\n\n{91}------------------------------------------------\n\n**Measurement category under IFRS 9** € thousand **2023** 2022 **Financial assets measured at amortised cost** Interest income 830 220 Impairment losses (–)/reversals of impairment losses (+) –139 –565 Foreign exchange gains (+)/foreign exchange losses (–) 1,795 2,859 2,486 2,514 **Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss** Impairment losses (–)/reversals of impairment losses (+) –369 427 **–369 427 Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost** Interest expenses –1,146 –745 Foreign exchange gains (+)/foreign exchange losses (–) –2,240 –1,560 **–3,386 –2,305 Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss** Interest expenses 0 0 Impairment losses (+)/reversals of impairment losses (–) 0 0 **0 0**\n\nThe net gains and losses recognised in accordance with IFRS are shown in the following table:\n\n#### **Risk analysis**\n\nThe Group is exposed to financial credit, default, liquidity and market risks in the course of business operations. Market risks relate, in particular, to interest rate and foreign exchange risks.\n\n### **Credit risk**\n\nCredit risk or default risk means the risk that a customer or counterparty of Eckert & Ziegler Group cannot meet its contractual obligations. The result of this is, firstly, the risk of value impairments on financial instruments due to issues of credit rating and, secondly, the risk of partial or complete loss of contractually agreed payments.\n\nThe Group is mainly exposed to credit and default risk based on its trade receivables. Risk is primarily influenced by the size of the customer and the country-specific rules and practices for processing the reimbursement of medical services by public authorities.\n\nAs a general rule, the Group obtains a credit rating for new customers, and first deliveries are only made against advance payment. Deliveries to customers that are considered a permanent risk due to their size or location are secured by advance payments or letters of credit. Credit and default risk is monitored as part of a Group-wide risk management system, which involves a regular analysis of overdue trade receivables.\n\n#### **Risk exposure**\n\nThe maximum default risk corresponded to the carrying amount of the trade receivables as at the reporting date in the amount of , thousand (previous year: , thousand).\n\nAs at the reporting date, a geographic breakdown of the maximum credit exposure with respect to current trade receivables was as follows:\n\n| € thousand        | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|\n| Europe            | 19,890 | 19,010 |\n| North America     | 13,866 | 9,900  |\n| South America     | 3,112  | 3,947  |\n| Asia/Pacific      | 5,864  | 0      |\n| Other             | 988    | 4,314  |\n| As at 31 December | 43,720 | 37,171 |\n\nThe risk of default is considered to be low. Due to the manageable number of customers, individual receivables items can be easily identified as impaired so that the Group recognises impairments in relation to expected loss events as well as objective indications of impairment, such as impending insolvency, if necessary. Expected probabilities of default are of secondary importance for the Group.\n\n{92}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe following classification of impaired receivables results from the analysis of receivables due and overdue:\n\n| € thousand                    | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Receivables not yet due       | 34,666 | 23,096 |\n| Past due 1 to 90 days         | 6,382  | 11,010 |\n| Past due by more than 90 days | 3,581  | 4,654  |\n| Trade receivables             | 44,629 | 38,760 |\n| Value adjustment              | -909   | -1,589 |\n| Net trade receivables         | 43,720 | 37,171 |\n\nThe change in impairment losses recognised for trade receivables was as follows:\n\n| € thousand        | 2023  | 2022  |\n|-------------------|-------|-------|\n| As at 1 January   | 1,589 | 1,210 |\n| Net additions     | -680  | 379   |\n| As at 31 December | 909   | 1,589 |\n\nThe reduction in impairments is mainly due to a payment from a customer whose receivables that have been overdue for years were recognised as not recognised in the past.\n\nSave for trade receivables, the balance sheet does not contain any overdue or impaired financial assets. The Group considers the default risk of these other financial assets to be very low.\n\n### **Liquidity risk**\n\nLiquidity risk means the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations on time. The purpose of liquidity management is to ensure that adequate amounts of borrowed and own funds are available all times. As part of the Group's financial planning, a liquidity forecast is prepared, which can be used, among other things, to identify additional debt financing needs in advance. The Group generates its financial resources predominantly through its operating activities. As at December , Eckert & Ziegler AG and its subsidiaries also had access to cash credit lines of , thousand (previous year: , thousand) if required. These credit lines had not been drawn down. The Group also has guarantee lines totalling , thousand (previous year: , thousand) of which , thousand (previous year: , thousand) was freely available as at December .\n\nAs at the reporting date, the consolidated balance sheet shows liabilities to banks totalling , thousand (previous year: , thousand) that must be repaid within years. In and , external financing was requested from banks or submitted independently by banks for various projects. The various loan offers contained favourable terms and conditions, which leads to the conclusion that the Group has a good credit rating. The Executive Board believes this is because of the Group's solid financing with a high equity ratio and the favourable prospects of the operating units. In addition to the high equity ratio, solid balance sheet ratios further underpin the Group's creditworthiness, as non-current assets are more than covered by equity and non-current liabilities.\n\nBased on its access to third-party financing and the forecast of liquidity requirements, it can be inferred that the Group currently has adequate financial resources to ensure its continued existence as a going concern. The Group also believes that it is in a position to meet all payment obligations, even if a slight increase in the debt ratio is necessary in the coming financial years in order to secure growth through further acquisitions, develop new locations and finance new product developments.\n\n{93}------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Risk exposure**\n\nThe contractually agreed due dates for financial liabilities are as follows:\n\n| ANALYSIS OF THE CONTRACTUALLY AGREED DUE DATES 31/12/2023 |                        |                 |            |                             |              |              |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|------------|-----------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| € thousand                                                |                        | Carrying amount | Fair value | Cash outflow (amortisation) |              |              |\n|                                                           |                        |                 | Total      | up to 1 year                | 2 to 5 years | over 5 years |\n| Loan liabilities                                          | fixed interest rate    | 8,888           | 8,431      | 1,352                       | 7,536        | 0            |\n| Loan liabilities                                          | variable interest rate | 17,500          | 17,500     | 5,000                       | 12,500       | 0            |\n| Trade payables                                            | non-interest bearing   | 5,868           | 5,868      | 5,868                       | 0            | 0            |\n| Other liabilities                                         | non-interest bearing   | 3,947           | 3,947      | 3,947                       | 0            | 0            |\n| Derivative financial liabilities                          | variable interest rate | 0               | 0          | 0                           | 0            | 0            |\n| As at 31 December                                         |                        | 36,203          | 35,746     | 16,167                      | 20,036       | 0            |\n\n#### ANALYSIS OF THE CONTRACTUALLY AGREED DUE DATES 31/12/2022\n\n| € thousand                       |                        | Carrying amount | Fair value | Cash outflow (amortisation) |              |              |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|------------|-----------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                  |                        |                 | Total      | up to 1 year                | 2 to 5 years | over 5 years |\n| Loan liabilities                 | fixed interest rate    | 6,400           | 6,095      | 0                           | 6,400        | 0            |\n| Loan liabilities                 | variable interest rate | 16,000          | 16,000     | 0                           | 16,000       | 0            |\n| Trade payables                   | non-interest bearing   | 8,340           | 8,340      | 8,340                       | 0            | 0            |\n| Other liabilities                | non-interest bearing   | 15,519          | 15,519     | 15,519                      | 0            | 0            |\n| Derivative financial liabilities | variable interest rate | 0               | 0          | 0                           | 0            | 0            |\n| As at 31 December                |                        | 46,259          | 45,954     | 23,859                      | 22,400       | 0            |\n\nThe cash outflows for the variable-interest liabilities in were based on an interest rate of M-euribor +. (previous year: .).\n\n### **Foreign exchange risks**\n\nThe Group's international business activity exposes it to foreign exchange risks resulting from the influence of exchange rate fluctuations on transactions as well as assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency (transaction risks).\n\nThe main foreign currency transactions in the Eckert & Ziegler Group relate to the US dollar as a result of loan repayments and dividend payments of the US-based subsidiaries and the export business of the German subsidiaries. This effect is only partially offset by the operating activity of several subsidiaries that buy components and goods mainly in US dollars and then sell the end products mainly in euros.\n\nIf necessary, export transactions in foreign currencies are hedged using foreign exchange options and forward transactions. There were no open positions under forward exchange options or forward transactions as at the reporting date.\n\n#### **Risk exposure**\n\nAs at the reporting date, the Group's exposure to transaction risk was as follows:\n\n| Foreign currency exposure | 31/12/2023 |       |       |     |       | 31/12/2022 |       |       |     |       |\n|---------------------------|------------|-------|-------|-----|-------|------------|-------|-------|-----|-------|\n| expressed in € thousand   | USD        | GBP   | ARS   | CZK | BRL   | USD        | GBP   | ARS   | CZK | BRL   |\n| Cash and cash equivalents | 17,366     | 1,433 | 460   | 661 | 1,381 | 25,882     | 1,200 | 1,050 | 577 | 1,966 |\n| Trade receivables         | 14,114     | 520   | 1,213 | 78  | 1,713 | 11,099     | 175   | 1,721 | 220 | 1,404 |\n| Trade payables            | -1,520     | -49   | -470  | -46 | 204   | -1,651     | -64   | -759  | -78 | -239  |\n| Balance sheet exposure    | 29,960     | 1,904 | 1,203 | 693 | 3,298 | 35,330     | 1,311 | 2,012 | 719 | 3,131 |\n\n### **Sensitivity analysis**\n\nProvided that all other assumptions remain unchanged, a appreciation of the euro against the following currencies would lead to the following increases (decreases) in comprehensive income as at the reporting date:\n\n|                                | 31/12/2023 |      |      |     |      | 31/12/2022 |      |      |     |      |\n|--------------------------------|------------|------|------|-----|------|------------|------|------|-----|------|\n| effect expressed in € thousand | USD        | GBP  | ARS  | CZK | BRL  | USD        | GBP  | ARS  | CZK | BRL  |\n| Comprehensive income           | -2,724     | -173 | -109 | -63 | -300 | -3,212     | -119 | -183 | -65 | -285 |\n\nA fall in the euro against the currencies listed above would have had a similar but opposite effect on the currencies listed as at the reporting date.\n\n{94}------------------------------------------------\n\nThe foreign exchange rates listed under Note were used as the basis for the sensitivity analysis.\n\n### **Interest rate risk**\n\nThe Group used an interest rate cap to hedge a . million loan over five years with a variable interest rate based on the -month Euribor. As with the loan, this interest rate cap has a nominal value of . million, a duration of five years, and a similar repayment structure. The strike takes place when the -month Euribor reaches .. As at December , the fair value of the derivative asset from the interest rate cap was thousand.\n\nWith regard to other interest rate risks, the Group's exposure to interest rate risk due to fluctuations in market interest rates is low for financial assets and liabilities with medium- to long-term maturities, since few of the assets and liabilities have variable interest rates.\n\nWith regard to the other items, no hedging is undertaken if a change in interest rates does not impact on cash flow.\n\n### **Risk exposure**\n\nThe Group had the following interest-bearing financial assets and liabilities as at the reporting date:\n\n| € thousand                             | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Interest-bearing financial assets      | 475    | 2,005  |\n| – thereof variable interest rate       | 0      | 0      |\n| – thereof fixed interest rate          | 475    | 2,005  |\n| Interest-bearing financial liabilities | 26,388 | 22,400 |\n| – thereof variable interest rate       | 17,500 | 16,000 |\n| – thereof fixed interest rate          | 8,888  | 6,400  |\n\n#### **Sensitivity of the cash flows for variable-interest financial instruments**\n\nAn increase in the market interest rate by basis points on the reporting date – keeping all other assumptions the same – would have led to the following increase (decrease) in the net profit or loss for the period:\n\n|                                                    | 2023               |                    | 2022               |                    |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| effect expressed in € thousand                     | + 100 basis points | – 100 basis points | + 100 basis points | – 100 basis points |\n| Result for variable-interest financial instruments | 0                  | 0                  | 0                  | 0                  |\n\nThe zero effect arises because an interest cap in the opposite direction and of almost the same amount acts against the (mathematically expected) increase in interest expense.\n\n### **Capital management**\n\nPursuant to Section of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), Eckert & Ziegler AG (parent company) is subject to minimum capitalisation in accordance with German stock corporation and commercial law rules. Accordingly, an Extraordinary General Meeting must be called if the sum of the parent company's equity as calculated in accordance with German commercial law rules falls below of the subscribed capital. This did not materialise in the and financial years.\n\nTo finance its growth strategy, the Group uses its own liquidity and, increasingly, external financing consisting of a mix of long-term loans and short-term cash credit lines, which can be drawn down flexibly depending on need and utilisation. The focus will continue to be on securing the Group's financing for the coming periods.\n\nThe Group pursues a conservative investment and borrowing policy geared towards flexibility and maintains a wellbalanced investment and financing portfolio. The Group is not subject to any external capital requirements. Ensuring the Group's liquidity and creditworthiness, including guaranteed access to the capital market at all times, and effectively increasing the company value are the main financial management objectives.\n\nMeasures to achieve these goals include capital structure optimisation, the dividend policy, acquisitions, and, if necessary, equity measures. Capital requirements and capital procurement should be coordinated in a manner that takes requirements in terms of earnings, liquidity, security, and autonomy into appropriate consideration. The Group's overall strategy has remained unchanged compared to .\n\n{95}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-95-0\"></span>**NOTES CONCERNING THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS**\n\nCash and cash equivalents reported in the consolidated statement of cash flows include cash and cash equivalents reported on the balance sheet, consisting of cash on hand, cheques, balances with financial institutions and all highly liquid assets with a residual maturity of no more than three months from the date of acquisition.\n\nThe consolidated statement of cash flows shows how the cash and cash equivalents of the Eckert & Ziegler Group changed during the financial year as a result of cash inflows and outflows. In accordance with IAS (Statement of Cash Flows), cash flows in the consolidated statement of cash flows are divided into cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.\n\nChanges in the balance sheet items examined for the development of the consolidated statement of cash flows are adjusted for the non-cash effects of currency translation and changes to the scope of consolidation. Furthermore, investing and financing transactions that did not have an impact on liquid assets are not included in the statement of cash flows. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, the changes in the respective balance sheet items reported in the consolidated statement of cash flows cannot be compared directly with the corresponding values in the published consolidated balance sheet.\n\n### **45 | OPERATINGACTIVITIES**\n\nCash inflows and outflows are determined indirectly, based on consolidated net income after taxes. Net income after taxes is adjusted for non-cash expenses and supplemented by changes in assets and liabilities.\n\n### **46 | INVESTING ACTIVITIES**\n\nCash flows from investing activities are calculated based actual payment transactions. They include cash flows related to the acquisition, production and sale of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment not included in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n### **47 | FINANCING ACTIVITIES**\n\nCash flows from financing activities are calculated based on actual payment transactions and include the taking out and repayment of loans and other financial liabilities, lease liabilities as well as cash flows between the Group and its shareholders, such as dividend payments.\n\nThe Group has elected to classify interest paid and interest received as cash flows from financing activities in accordance with IAS ..\n\n### **Discontinued operations**\n\n| € thousand                                | 31/12/2023 | 31/12/2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Cash flow from operating activities       | 2,197      | -3,654     |\n| Cash outflow from investing activities    | -4,940     | -4,046     |\n| Cash inflow from financing activities     | 11,358     | 5,456      |\n| Cash outflow from discontinued operations | 8,615      | -2,244     |\n\n{96}------------------------------------------------\n\n# <span id=\"page-96-0\"></span>**OTHER DISCLOSURES**\n\n### **48 |OTHERFINANCIAL OBLIGATIONSAND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND RECEIVABLES**\n\nThe Group's most important companies issue letters of comfort to third parties in order to secure the liabilities and obligations of affiliated companies (e.g. under leases or as a contract performance guarantee). Directly enforceable maximum-sum guarantees are also provided to secure all claims under surety and credit lines as well as under loan agreements of subsidiaries. The company does not expect any claims under these.\n\nThe following events are of importance:\n\nWhen the German Radiation Protection Act (StrlSchG) entered into force on January , the supervisory authority was given the ability to require the posting of security for legacy facilities as well. This security also relates to radioactive materials that originate from handling. In December , Eckert & Ziegler Nuclitec GmbH, as licence holder for the Braunschweig location, was ordered to post security of . million. In order to avoid tying up liquidity at the overall Group level of Eckert & Ziegler, this security was posted in the form of a letter of comfort from EZAG, which was sent on time to the competent supervisory authority for approval. The draft of this letter of comfort is still awaiting approval by the authorities.\n\nAnother subsidiary received a licence to handle other radioactive substances in summer in accordance with Section () no. of the Radiation Protection Act (StrSchG). In August , the company issued a letter of comfort to the Free State of Saxony, represented by the Saxon State Office for Agriculture, Environment and Geology (LfULG), to secure the obligation of this subsidiary to dispose of such radioactive substances resulting from the handling of the licence. The obligation is limited to , thousand.\n\nIn addition, Eckert & Ziegler Radiopharma GmbH provided a letter of comfort to the lessor of an affiliate, stating it is at all times capable of properly removing the radioactive waste temporarily stored at the leased property or of temporarily storing it elsewhere.\n\n### **49| SEGMENT REPORTING**\n\nIn accordance with IFRS , operating segments must be separately identified based on the Group's internal management reporting. These internal segments are those that are regularly audited by the Group's main decision-makers with regard to decisions about the distribution of resources to this segment and the assessment of its financial performance.\n\nThe individual segments offer different products and are also organisationally separated by location. The applied accounting standards of the individual segments are consistent with those described in the summary of the main accounting policies (Note ). Segment information is not consolidated. This corresponds to the information used by the Executive Board as part of regular management reporting. Intra-group leases are not accounted for in accordance with IFRS , and no corresponding right-of-use assets or lease liabilities are thus recognised under segment assets or segment liabilities. Transactions between the segments are settled at market prices.\n\nThe **Isotope Products** segment manufactures and distributes standards and radiation sources for medical and industrial purposes. Standards are radioisotopes for calibration purposes. They are generally sold to scientific institutions. Industrial radiation sources are found in various measuring equipment for industrial facilities and other measuring devices, for example, safety equipment at airports and in crude oil exploration. They are sold to the manufacturers or operators of plants and systems. The medical radiation sources include radioactive sources for the calibration of gamma cameras. The production sites for this segment are located in Europe and in North and South America. Worldwide revenue and distribution also takes place from these locations. In addition, the segment offers a variety of services: taking back sources from customers and accepting low-level isotope technology waste, e.g. from hospitals and other facilities, processing and conditioning of radioactive waste, recycling of isotope technology material, transport and logistics, arranging service technicians for the inspection, maintenance and commissioning of irradiation systems, professional disposal of waste and restoration. This means that the Isotope Products segment offers the entire range of services relating to radiation sources for medical and industrial purposes.\n\nIn the **Medical** segment, the largest share of revenue is generated from pharmaceutical-quality radioactive ingredients that play a diagnostic or therapeutic role as part of a medication. The most important items include the Ge/Ga radionuclide <sup>68</sup>Ge/<sup>68</sup>Ga radionuclide generator GalliaPharm<sup>®</sup>, which enables the radioactive labelling of carrier molecules for the purpose of the sensitive diagnosis of various types of cancers, and the therapeutic isotopes yttrium-, lutetium- and phosphorous-. Yttrium- has a number of uses, such as in the production of radioactive embolizers for the treatment of liver tumours\n\nIn addition, the segment markets products designed for radiation therapists, a group of doctors that is specialised in treating cancer through irradiation. The two most important products are small implants for the treatment of prostate cancer based on iodine- (so-called \"seeds\") and eye applicators based on ruthenium- and iodine- for the treatment of uveal melanomas (eye cancer).\n\n{97}------------------------------------------------\n\nFinally, the Medical segment includes a project business directed at international medication developers, which provides them with support in the development and approval of new radiopharmaceuticals, the manufacture of test batches, and the development of production facilities and the associated infrastructure. The business is grouped around a plant engineering department located in Dresden, whose range of products is supplemented by laboratory equipment, radiosynthesis equipment, quality-control equipment and consumables, as well as a wide array of services.\n\nThe **Other** segment comprises the items of the holding company Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG as well as Pentixapharm AG and Myelo Therapeutics GmbH.\n\n| SEGMENT REPORTING                                           |  |                  |         |         |        |        |        |             |        |         |

id=\"page-105-0\"></span>**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR´S REPORT**\n\nTo Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG, Berlin\n\n### **Audit opinions**\n\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as of 31 December 2023, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated cash-flow statement for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the group management report of Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. In accordance with German legal requirements we have not audited the content of those parts of the group management report listed in the \"Other information\" section of our auditor's report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e (1) HGB and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as of 31 December 2023, and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023, and\n- the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the group management report does not cover the content of the parts of the group management report listed in the \"Other information\" section of our auditor's report.\n\nPursuant to § 322 (3) sent. 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\n{106}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Basis for the audit opinions**\n\nWe conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No. 537/2014, referred to subsequently as \"EU Audit Regulation\") and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW) [Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer in Deutschland. Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the \"Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report\" section of our auditor's report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\n# **Key audit matters in the audit of the consolidated financial statements**\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon, we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\n# *IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL*\n\n# **Related information in the consolidated financial statements**\n\nFor information on the accounting and valuation principles applied to goodwill, please refer to the disclosures in section 3 \"Significant accounting and valuation principles\" (\"Goodwill\" and \"Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment\") in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Quantitative disclosures on goodwill are included in the notes to the consolidated balance sheet in section 26 \"Intangible assets\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n# **Facts and risk for the audit**\n\nGoodwill amounting to € 35.7 million is reported in the consolidated financial statements of Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG. Goodwill represents 17 % of non-current assets.\n\n{107}------------------------------------------------\n\nGoodwill is subjected to an annual impairment test by the company in order to determine a possible need for amortization. As a result of the impairment test, there was no need for impairment in the reporting year. The result of these valuations depends to a large extent on how the legal representatives estimate future cash surpluses and derive the discount rates used in each case. Due to the uncertainties underlying the valuation and the subjective assumptions and estimates used in the valuation, the recoverability of goodwill is a key audit matter in the context of our audit.\n\n### **Audit approach and findings**\n\nAs part of our audit, we analyzed the process implemented by the Executive Board of Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG and the accounting policies for determining the recoverable amounts of cash-generating units to which goodwill was allocated for potential risks of error with the support of our company's valuation specialists and obtained an understanding of the process steps. We assessed the Company's methodology for determining the capitalization rates and for deriving the fair values.\n\nWe analyzed the corporate planning by comparing it with the results actually achieved in the past and current developments in the business figures. We verified the key assumptions of the corporate planning regarding growth and business development by discussing them in detail with the management of Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG. On this basis, we assessed their appropriateness.\n\nWe analyzed the parameters used to determine the discount rates with regard to their appropriate derivation and verified their calculation in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36.\n\nWe used sensitivity analyses to assess impairment risks in the event of changes in significant valuation assumptions. We also verified the mathematical accuracy of the valuation models in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36.\n\nOn the basis of our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors with regard to the recoverability of goodwill are justified and balanced.\n\n# *DISCLOSURE AND MEASUREMENT OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS*\n\n### **Related information in the consolidated financial statements**\n\nInformation on discontinued operations can be found in section 10 \"Discontinued operations\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and in section 1.1 \"Group business model\" of the Group management report.\n\n{108}------------------------------------------------\n\n### **Facts and risk for the audit**\n\nIn October 2023, the Supervisory Board of Eckert & Ziegler AG granted the Executive Board its approval for a spin-off of up to 100 % of the shares in Pentixapharm AG. Pentixapharm AG and its subsidiary Myelo Therapeutics GmbH form the division comprising the Group's clinical assets, which is to be discontinued in the future and was classified as a discontinued operation in accordance with IFRS 5 from this date. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements of Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG show assets classified as held for sale in the Clinical Assets division in the amount of € 65.3 million and associated liabilities classified as held for sale in the amount of € 21.8 million. A result from discontinued operations of € -3.7 million is reported in the consolidated income statement for the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe allocation of the assets, liabilities, expenses and income of the Clinical Assets division and therefore the disclosure as a discontinued operation in accordance with IFRS 5 are complex. In addition, there is a risk for the consolidated financial statements that the valuation of the disposal group is not appropriate. With regard to the explanatory disclosures on the discontinued operation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, there is a risk that the presentation is not sufficiently detailed and appropriate. The recognition and measurement of the discontinued operation Clinical Assets was therefore a key audit matter in the context of our audit.\n\n### **Audit approach and findings**\n\nWe assessed the process initiated to spin off the division on the basis of the company's documentation and by interviewing the Management Board and the Supervisory Board. As part of our audit, we also assessed whether the assets and liabilities as well as the income and expenses of Pentixapharm AG and Myelo Therapeutics GmbH were correctly allocated to the discontinued operation. In order to assess the valuation of the assets classified as held for sale, we reviewed the final valuation and purchase price allocation reports commissioned by the Company for the assets of Myelo Therapeutics GmbH with the support of our company's valuation specialists. Furthermore, with regard to the recoverability of the assets, we inspected the current status of the documents of the valuation expert commissioned by the company to prepare the spin-off, analyzed them, verified the key valuation parameters and had the expert explain the procedure to us. In addition, we assessed whether the presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the Group management report on the discontinued operation is sufficiently detailed and appropriate.\n\nOn the basis of our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors with regard to the allocation of assets and liabilities as well as expenses and income and thus the presentation of the Clinical Assets division as a discontinued operation in accordance with IFRS 5 and with regard to the recoverability of the assets classified as held for sale are appropriate. The presentation of the discontinued operations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements is sufficiently detailed and appropriate.\n\n{109}------------------------------------------------\n\n# *MEASUREMENT OF PROVISIONS FOR RESTORATION OBLIGATIONS AND PROVISIONS FOR DISPOSAL OBLIGATIONS*\n\n**Related information in the consolidated financial statements**\n\nInformation on provisions can be found in section 3 \"Significant accounting policies\" (\"Provisions\") and in section 40 \"Other provisions\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n**Facts and risk for the audit**\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements of Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG, provisions for decommissioning obligations amounting to € 35.9 million are reported under \"Other non-current provisions\". In addition, provisions for the obligation to process own radioactive waste and radioactive waste accepted from third parties as well as take-back obligations for sold radiation sources (hereinafter referred to as \"provisions for disposal obligations\") amounting to € 28.8 million are reported under \"other non-current provisions\" and € 6.4 million under \"other current provisions\".\n\nGroup companies of Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG produce isotope technology components, irradiation equipment and radiopharmaceuticals in their own and in rented buildings, as a result of which the production facilities and buildings used for this purpose are contaminated. Due to existing obligations to restore the site to its condition prior to decontamination, provisions must be recognized for restoration obligations.\n\nIn the production process of Group companies of Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG, radioactive waste is produced and, in addition, Group companies of Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG accept radioactive waste from third parties for disposal. Provisions must be formed for these disposal obligations.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 37, the provisions must be measured on the basis of the best possible estimate of the expenses associated with the obligation as at the balance sheet date. All risks and uncertainties must be taken into account. Non-current provisions must be discounted to the present value of the expenses on the reporting date.\n\nThe calculation of the decommissioning and disposal obligations is based on various assumptions, which are based on estimates that essentially relate to the following parameters:\n\n{110}------------------------------------------------\n\n- Time at which the costs of decontamination or disposal are incurred (including the time at which the residual materials are released),\n- Development of legal regulations, e.g. on limit values and required measures regarding the handling of radioactive substances (including forecast of disposal routes),\n- Development of the costs of decontamination and disposal,\n- Discount factor.\n\nDue to the uncertainty associated with the assumptions and estimates made by the executive directors and the amounts involved, the measurement of the provisions for restoration and disposal obligations was a key audit matter in the context of our audit.\n\n### **Audit approach and findings**\n\nTo assess the provisions for restoration obligations, we evaluated the legal representatives' approach to determining the measures to be taken (e.g. cleaning). In order to identify the expected date of demolition, we assessed, among other things, the lease term in accordance with the existing lease agreements and reconciled this with the underlying schedule. We reviewed the scope of the measures and the dismantling obligations as well as the costs assumed by the legal representatives for the valuation. For this purpose, we reconciled the production facilities with the schedule of assets as part of a deliberate selection process and assessed the assumed costs by comparing the estimated costs with the current costs. In addition, we obtained an expert opinion on the measures to be implemented and the expected costs, which we assessed as part of our audit.\n\nIn order to assess the provisions for disposal obligations, we first obtained an understanding of the process of systematically recording and updating the quantities of radioactive waste. We compared these inventories with the inventory of radioactive residues on a sample basis. We gained an understanding of the assumptions and expectations made by the legal representatives in their planning with regard to the disposal routes, the associated costs and the planned disposal dates. In doing so, we examined the planning assumptions for the years following the balance sheet date by scrutinizing and assessing the planning parameters in detail, in particular the planned cost trends and disposal dates.\n\nFurthermore, we assessed the discount rates used by the client and verified the calculation of the present values of the provisions.\n\nOn the basis of our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the estimates and assumptions made by the legal representatives with regard to the measurement of the provisions for restoration obligations and disposal obligations are justified and balanced.\n\n{111}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Other information**\n\nThe legal representatives or the Supervisory Board are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the following non-audited components of the Group management report:\n\n- the corporate governance statement pursuant to Section 289f and Section 315d HGB, to which reference is made in the Group management report,\n- the separate non-financial report pursuant to Section 315b (3) HGB, to which reference is made in the Group management report\n- the remuneration report pursuant to Section 162 AktG, to which reference is made in the Group management report, and\n- the non-management report disclosures in section 5.1 of the Group management report relating to the EU taxonomy;\n\nThe other information also includes:\n\n- the assurances pursuant to Section 297 (2) sentence 4 and Section 315 (1) sentence 5 HGB on the consolidated financial statements and Group management report\n- the report of the Supervisory Board and\n- the remaining parts of the annual report excluding cross-references to external information - with the exception of the audited consolidated financial statements and group management report and our auditor's report.\n\nThe legal representatives and the Supervisory Board are jointly responsible for the remuneration report. The Supervisory Board is responsible for the report of the Supervisory Board. Furthermore, the legal representatives are responsible for the other information.\n\nOur opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information:\n\n- is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the group management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or\n- otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\n{112}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **Responsibilities of the executive directors and the supervisory board for the consolidated financial statements and the group management report**\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e (1) HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\n# **Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report**\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\n{113}------------------------------------------------\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) [and supplementary compliance with the ISAs] will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our [audit] opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.\n- conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n- evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e (1) HGB.\n\n{114}------------------------------------------------\n\n- obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n- evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n- perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the actions taken or safeguards applied to eliminate independence threats.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n{115}------------------------------------------------\n\n# **OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS**\n\n# **REPORT ON THE ASSURANCE ON THE ELECTRONIC RENDERING, OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE GROUP MANAGEMENT REPORT, PREPARED FOR PUBLICATION PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH § 317 (3A) HGB**\n\n# **Assurance opinion**\n\nWe have performed assurance work in accordance with § 317 (3a) HGB to obtain rea-sonable assurance as to whether the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report (hereinafter the \"ESEF documents\") contained in the attached electronic file 391200EUDABLUKXCKG48-2023-12-31-de (MD5-hash value: 87ab035fe55f4d69e6f5f0a4446712f2) and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of § 328 (1) HGB for the electronic reporting format (\"ESEF format\").
